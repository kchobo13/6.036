1	B000QTAH1M	A2HG80UPS2APUM	Great to find this hard to find spice	This spice used in Caribbean cooking is not easy to find in Texas. It was nice to find it on Amazon.	1	0
1	B001EO5UTM	A1AW7OTQ9QX3IG	olive oil	This is great for cooking and gift giving.  I like that it's in cans, takes less space, and is organic.  Not the best I've had, but for daily use and cooking it's great.<br />I have it on subscribe and save every 4-6 months or so.  I live alone, so they last a long time.  I use olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, for everything . . . I don't use butter or other oils anymore.<br /><br />Great product, well packaged for shipping, since Amazon likes to just toss things in a box without protecting anything.  This company thinks ahead, and the cans are very well protected for shipping.<br /><br />They are much smaller than they seem on the computer,  because of the shape, I guess.  Still a great value, even though they raise the price every order by about $2.00, so I probably will be shopping for another brand by next order..	1	0
-1	B0002I0GXG	A1QP2GHTI063EF	High Price	This is a good Dog food, But I found 4Health at Tractor Supply. It is equal to or better quality comparing the analysis. And the price is much better, half as much. My Lab loves it, firm stools, and has been eating it for 9 months. She has a beautiful chocolate coat. She really didn't like the wellness product that much, and she had runny stools while eating it.	3	1
1	B002SUT74K	A1OGJ3XOJFD2K2	Best chai ever	Very very gingery, which suits me just fine.  Also very strong chai.  Sometimes instead of equal parts chai and milk, I use about a 1.5-to-1 ratio of milk to chai.  The most satisfying chai I've ever had and more spicy than sweet.  Also sold at Whole Foods for about $1 less per quart, but the free shipping and convenience of delivery plus guarantee of availability from Amazon on this item vs. the gallons of gas my car would require to get to WF give Amazon the edge.  This is a superior product for ginger lovers only.	4	0
1	B0019446LK	AIAQQAAE5G2VR	Invigorating!!!	"Wow, at first I was thinking ""caffeine free""?  Eh.  But, sniff the satchel packet and you'll be instantly invigorated with the sinus clearing powerful mint!  It's really minty, what you'd expect it to taste like.  Doesn't need sugar, it's sweet enough by itself.  I don't really taste the lemon in it."	0	0
1	B001BDI0RK	A2GYSKRZ8VJVR3	Great for difficult cat	We have a difficult Indoor Cat, with a sensitive stomach and this has been the only food he can eat and not throw up constantly.  I would not say it gets rid of hair balls but I think it has really cut down on the number of hairballs we have to live through.  Weight wise, I dont see his indoor life causeing weight gain so it must be helping there as well.  I wish the price was not so high, but on subscribe and save, I save money, and never run out.....	0	0
-1	B001YJ9IM2	A23HRTD9I9K90Z	Cinnamon is as cinnamon does	Another clown bakery that mixes cocoa powder with cinnamon thinking to reach more ill-informed customers that way. Cinnamon all by itself is the way these things are traditionally made. Don't fix it if it ain't broken!	0	0
1	B000HDK0DC	A2MWDJVGV0KATO	TASTE AWESOME!!!	I LOVE these lollipops, and have never tried a flavor I didn't like.  I definitely appreciate the lack of high fructose corn syrup and artificial colors when I'm looking for an occasional treat to satisfy my sweet tooth!<br />There is a nice mix of flavors, but for those who are picky, they are not evenly distributed.  Of the 330 lollipops I received in my 5-lb. bag,<br />64 (19%) Tart Sour Apple<br />58 (18%) Googly Grape<br />39 (12%) Mango Tango<br />32 (10%) Strawberry Smash<br />28 (8%) Ginger Zest<br />25 (8%) Wet-face Watermelon<br />24 (7%) Pomegranate Pucker<br />22 (7%) Cheeky Lemon<br />17 (5%) Orange Squeeze<br />11 (3%) Blood Orange Cocktail<br />8 (2%) Very Very Cherry<br />2 (&lt;1%) Tooberry Blueberry	223	5
-1	B00485BHSW	AWPN47SSWK1JV	Poor Quality	Material is very thin and the shirt had several spots where the color was faded.<br />The only thing that it had going for it was the fact that it was cheap, but I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.	2	0
1	B005CMAENO	AAE80E4EVOW2S	A lot of paste	This almond paste is a great product, it just that there is a lot of it.  I wish they would produce a 1 or 2 pound can.  One good thing is we can make a lot of almond cookies with it.<br /><br />The paste works well in recipes and turns out without being gritty which was a problem trying to make our own past.  Good flavor and no noticeable difference in finished product from home made.  this will work with just about any recipe that calls for almonds in a paste or even in some cases a powder form.	1	0
1	B001TM70V0	A2U7HH4BJ6K5Y2	Weruva Mideast Feast-Great buy & Product	All of my cats love this grain-free cat food! It not only a great product, but the value through Amazon can't be beat. Even if I buy it locally, I still pay more per can and that doesn't include the gas to get there and back. Love having it delivered to my door and with the super saver shipping the price and convenience is a super saver deal!!	0	0
1	B002XWFK3U	A148PH0MI6JFFG	Just as good as ever.	These nuts are just as good as ever. I just wish I could find them locally. Now I have enough to last me for quite awhile!	2	0
1	B001NXOCRA	A1R504UI0QTAPU	Long time Fit user says thumbs up	About ten years ago P&G developed Fit to clean fruits and vegtables. It was sold in many stores and that was my first source.<br /><br />Sine P&G is noted for their R&D, I have to believe that the product is effective and safe. Our family uses Fit to clean all of our produce. It does get the dirt off and yes you can see the junk in the bottom of the bowl.<br /><br />About six years ago I started to buy Fit directly from the company that acquired the brand, and more recently through Amazon. I am convinced that it works and leaves no noticeable taste or residue.	0	0
1	B0058M8RZA	A215W0A8MQS1V9	Coffee MarTEAni is INSTANTLY ADDICTIVE!!	I first tasted these at our local Whole Foods, was hooked from my first taste, and then came hunting for a better price on Amazon (and found it).  I get them on subscriber shipments now--the coffee/chai combination is out of this world!	0	0
-1	B001O3DQ2Q	A3GSXX2CMCW320	Mentos Sugar Free Gum - Tropical Flavor	Mentos Sugar Free Gum - Tropical Flavor: Good taste, convenient packaging with no need to unwrap each piece of gum, expensive. Most importantly, the flavor doesn't last as long as the others.	0	0
-1	B001EQ55ZO	A1KXJCXS6HFRQZ	Good.  A little overpowering.	I think these would have been better without the pepper -- or maybe just a little less pepper.  It creates a very overpowering taste.  I can only eat 2 or 3 at a time.<br /><br />The cashews themselves are soft and delicious.  The packaging is nice -- resealable and recyclable.<br /><br />So if you like salty nuts, you may like this.  I prefer my nuts lightly salted and with just a little pepper.	0	1
1	B00198JXW8	A1REIDRM78Y3UO	ToxiClenz	I first received this product from my chiropractor about 7 years ago and have been using it sinse.  When my digestive system isn't doing well I always reach for my ToxiClenz and I start to feel better in about two days. A wonderful product!!!	2	0
-1	B004Q4C694	A1MEK5TKHI0CEO	Old Over Dried Yuck	I drink a lot of kuchika and this is the worst I've tasted so far. Out of the bag it looks old and overly dry.  Maybe it is old or maybe it was over dried. No fresh green notes here. Yuck.	0	0
1	B007PA33KM	A3A02ZHIEXYCUB	Love This Coffee!	This is my favorite coffee. Perfect level of strength. Excellent flavor. It's bold and robust without being too intense. It tastes like morning.	0	0
1	B001JYU0BK	AJTR3W7GOYV0I	THE BEST!	I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly . Not only are her teeth cleaner but some of the staining has gone away. Our vet told us that these are the best thing for her because they digest easily and do not contain plastics.	0	0
1	B0009F3SA0	A2FEC016SACDJ9	Knocked me out	I picked up Yogi Bedtime Tea because a) I'm a tea lover and b) I was searching for teas that might make me sleepy. So far, Yogi's Bedtime is the only one that does the job. One mug makes me pretty drowsy and ready to go to sleep. Two mugs make me very loopy and three mugs just put me under. I sleep through the night and wake up feeling slightly groggy; however, the feeling passes quickly and I'm ready to start my morning. If you're having a hard time getting to sleep, or if you know you need to sleep but just aren't ready to settle down yet, this can help.<br /><br />I notice the information for this tea advises you to drink it during the day to calm and relax yourself. I can't imagine doing that. I would pass right out. (Definitely don't drink this before driving anywhere!)<br /><br />The tea is sweetened with Stevia which does leave a taste in the back of your mouth. It is not altogether unpleasant but might irritate some.<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer mentioned, some of the ingredients in this tea can interact with certain medications such as hormonal birth control, so be advised and ask your doctor first.	8	0
1	B005K4Q4LK	ALDAF4VVLFRHP	Wonderful taste, warms and wakes me up on those cold winter mornings	I got this since I enjoy cappuccino. I like the fact that I can make these at home, and one cup at a time so that I can make them when I am actually ready for it and it is not sitting around getting cold or old. It has just the right amount of Hazelnut. Living in UpState New York, our mornings can be cold and hard to get up in the morning. This is great to help in the morning.	0	0
1	B004M8KYCK	A3R40O403XN8UZ	THE BEST	Absolutely the best. Hands down I love this over any other coffee I have tried. Yes, it really does the layers if you have a glass cup. Only downside is I went through them so fast cause they are delicious.	2	0
1	B00474G7KW	AKQHIWNAQSZPP	Berry-licious!	What can I say, I love this granola!  The berries really make my yogurt pop!  Great taste and not cardboard-like as so many gluten-free products are.	0	0
1	B006W6YHHI	A1TY4AX8AVRAYQ	greenies	This is great!!! first time my dog had greenies is when I bought a single. He is a picky eater and we were desprate to do something about his breath. He loved it and helped his breath. We buy big boxes of them now.	0	0
1	B000EHL21U	A20TTFFACVBYRA	Super satisfying!	With 190 calories, 12 grams of fiber and 6 of protein, this little bar packs a lot of nutrition in one small package. It will keep you from being hungry for hours. I love the combination of chewy and crunchy.	0	1
1	B001EO5TJ8	A2SF1TJBQZR3JW	Excellent English Breakfast Tea	I have been searching for the 'right' balanced English Breakfast Tea for a few years now. Other than actual English Teas from London, England, it was very difficult to find a rich and aromatic English Breakfast.<br /><br />After trying out at least 20 different varieties, including some very expensive brands, I've found this to be the perfect cuppa in the morning. Personally, loose leaf seems to taste a lot better to me, and I've not tried the tea-bag variety on this one.<br /><br />Hope others enjoy this tea as much as I have.	0	0

1	B006KK4GUO	A1IZWEMEJ3LSHA	Very similar to Biscoff Spread	I can tell you exactly what this tastes like, and pretty much what it is...creamed butter (or rather a healthier variety of margarine), brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon solidified to a peanut butter consistency.<br />I purchased some Biscoff Spread at Publix in Florida last month (the crunchy variety), the Publix in Georgia doesn't carry it so I thought I'd try TJ's Cookie Butter and they are so very similar.  The taste of both is that of the airline cookies made by Biscoff, Lotus.  It is good, but not a health food.  There are no trans fats in any of Trader Joe's products.  They would be a fun spread for parties or a gift basket.	1	0
1	B007JFMH8M	A2PFH1741A25BG	Sooo yummy!	I got a free bar in my voxbox from influenster and wow!! Soo yummy!! It melts in your mouth and even my 2 year old loved it!	0	0

1	B000FVBYCW	A3V9M50SZJ2A2D	Served its purpose	I do not really like tea but I needed to drink it for medical reasons.  Shipping was really fast and the price was good.  I am sure those who like Sage Tea would love it.	1	1
1	B0090X8IPM	A2O9HU1K7TCF7B	The Scent of Vanilla	Having already tried the caramel fusion and enjoying it, I decided to give vanilla a try.  I am not normally a fan of vanilla coffee as the smells is often more potent than the taste.  You can always tell when somebody has been in the room with vanilla coffee because the artificial scent lingers.  Whereas other vanilla coffees have the vanilla ending in the scent, this coffee has a nice mild taste that does actually hint of vanilla.  It is not a vanilla taste that overpowers the taste of the coffee like a sugary creamer, it is authentic and subtle.  The coffee even has a smooth mouthfeel that brings hints of creme soda.  Overall, this is a worthy addition to the Starbucks family.	1	0
1	B003M63C0E	A2U06B6B5OK5ZZ	Good product..But dogs hate it!	My dogs hate it... I dont know if its just the flavor because my dogs dont even eat tuna fish. I am going to try the chicken next...	0	0
-1	B000LQMY02	A5X4ZSW5HF1LW	Unprofessional product	Item different from website description.  Claims it colors 30 eggs...package received says it colors 6 eggs.  This packaging was not as shown. The product arrived in a make-shift envelope...even the label was crooked. I paid $5.02 for shipping and the product arrived in an envelope with one postage stamp.	0	0
1	B000RI3SKY	A2LGQ6XZKLRA32	Your pet will love you!	My cat hates his meds. It was a knock-down fight each morning. Then a friend recomended Pill Pockets. Now I have to fight him long enough to get the pill in the pocket and give it to him. And he is purring all the time. We are both very pleased with this product. If you have a pill shy pet, dog or cat this is the way to go.	0	0
1	B000NHZK96	A1HDXNV61FUSCI	nice and easy to use	The wooden mat is durable and the seaweed us good quality. I haven't had trouble with it at all for the month that i've had it and it makes excellent sushi!	0	0

1	B000FZRYPO	A265M6WN5N46DW	Great taste for a low carb option!	Even though a few of the bags were ripped and the noodles spilled into the box, these were a great find. It is very hard to find decent tasting pasta / noodles for a low carb lifestyle and these are delicious! Taste like egg noodles to me!	0	0
1	B001D0DMME	A1LFSTBR7L7PUT	a bit of heaven in a bar	We are on a special diet and there are very few bars that are healthy and have no ingredients that are bad for us.  This is one of them.  This is also incredibly delicious.  My husband, who has a lot of trouble chewing, says these bars are so good he doesn't mind the effort it takes to eat one!<br /><br />I've ordered these twice, but now that hubby has found out how good they are we might be ordering 2 boxes at a time in the future.<br /><br />If you want a quick pick-me-up snack that is healthy and tastes better than most candy, try these!	0	0
1	B000WL39JQ	A1C3NFO4NTCWG7	Good Variety	I ordered this assorted variety candy bar set. I liked it alot and would for sure order again. It came on time and no issuse at all with the order.	5	1
1	B0006M13X0	A1J2TAASDRXSE6	Best dog food--no ear infections	Before my oldest golden started eating this food he got a lot of ear infections. He ate grain free food, but he still got them. Both my dogs like this food and their coats are nice and shiny and their ears are super clean. I really recommend it.<br /><br />While you can get it for $1 cheaper on other sites, you pay $18 for shipping.<br /><br />I only wish Amazon had more than 3 bags of it each time!	0	0

-1	B000IEFVX4	AA2UPO06AMW9Z	Not currants	Given the cost, I had finally believed that I had found dried currants.  Wrong; they got me again - they sold me Zante raisins and NOT currants.	16	1
1	B003D4MW38	AQXJM6TILVEDY	Excellent	I've come to trust the Stash brand, among only a few others due to its consistently excellent product line and variety.  I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back.  A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea.<br /><br />If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you.  I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards.  This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids.	13	0
1	B000G6RYNE	AKMEY1BSHSDG7	Crunch. Wow!	Not too salty like regular supermarket chips, this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt! When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.<br /><br />There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.<br /><br />This is an excellent product!	1	0
-1	B004FEJ968	AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS	C+ Concensus on Crispy Cranberry Cookie	First impression: meh. I sampled a few more, and the flavor kind of grew on me. You can taste all the ingredients you're supposed to notice--oats, cranberries, a little hint of citrus. Then I tried it with my coffee, and it was GOOD.<br /><br />I think that's the key--other reviewers have noted that tea or coffee goes great with this snack. It's not something you can mindlessly shove into your mouth while watching reality shows, not that I ever do that, but if you need a little treat in the afternoon, it's tasty with a cup of joe.<br /><br />The cranberries made this chewy, which was a nice combination (like pinwheel cookies). Putting two textures together can be tricky, and if not done correctly, is a real turn-off for me. But here the crunchy/chewy textures enhance each other.<br /><br />My family tasted these, as well. One of my kids liked the cookie but thought the calorie count a little high for a serving of three (140 calories). Not a big deal, but if you're going for the health-conscious crowd, that may be a little too steep. Other household members said these cookies were average, but then they lean toward big gooey chocolate desserts.<br /><br />So try these--but don't forget to fire up Mr. Coffee first.	0	0
1	B000XSCXIG	A3A53A50YEIR2A	Cinnamon Sensation	This tea has a superb taste.  I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner.  Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea, but this is also a very delicious hot drink too!  I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it.  Fabulous!	0	0
1	B000G7TC38	A2API8M3OQ68EG	A great, low fat product	Was looking for a low fat/no fat pretzel and this one was recommended by the Slim Fast diet plan.  Well, my husband (who is not on a diet, of course) loves them, too!	3	0

-1	B0009YD7P2	A3MKRHXADWES1Z	Well..	I guess I wasnt expecting to pay over 15 bucks at the end of this purchase for one bottle, I guess the picture on this product threw me off.  After shipping-you are paying this amount-look around you can find it here on amazon for about 7 plus free shipping.  What a waste.	0	1

1	B0001FQVCA	A3K34XYFMYAD1Z	Slurpishly good nutty chocolate	This is a really good spread! The blended nutty flavor really hits the spot. I don't just spread it on my slices of bread but made cake rolls with it! making it tasted yummier!	4	1
1	B000PY89CW	A3DEMKI51WFL68	Fun and Cool snack	This is a really cool product. For the first part you arn't paying a arm and a leg at the museums. It tastes pretty good. It is a wierd texture to explain. It is a chalky texture, but when it hits your mouth it gets creamy. Try to think its not cold frozen ice cream. its going to be like room temp. The only down side i see is the secondary wrapper inside. Its almost always broken or wripped. But, its nothing to ruin the product. Its sealed with the outside packaging. So i dont see why the other package is there. Unless its to help control the moisture.	1	0
1	B0083T6HC0	A11MQJ2XYI12RE	35 wonderful cups!  Good variety!	I was nervous about buying a sample package because we aren't big fans of the extra bold coffees but I didn't want to buy another pack of one kind and have the same 20 cups in a row.<br /><br />We received the package today and it was in a brown bag that was stapled at the top (that bag was in another box since we ordered something else too) but all the cups were in fine condition.  There were 35 different cups and surprisingly there were only a couple extra bolds.  None of the cups were expired and most had months before the did expire.  We got a lot of Grove Square (7-8) and Wolfgang Puck (4), Green Mountain (4) but the rest were pretty varied.  We got hot chocolates (we already had those and they were tasty), ciders, flavored coffees, teas, regular coffees, cappuccinos, and I think one is actually an energy booster or something (Revv?)and a couple of specialty/seasonal coffees.<br /><br />I would definitely order this pack again and recommend it if you aren't too particular about what you are looking for and just want to try a bunch of different cups.	0	0
1	B000PDWBKO	A2QZ5DZDHJSRWR	Yes, this is the stuff you're looking for.	"These little packets have everything you need to make commercial-quality popcorn.  Two pouches in each packet:  one with popcorn and flavored salt (flavacol, or something just like it), and one with that bright orange oil (solid at room temperature).  The yellow color, the flavor and the salt all find their way into the popcorn.  If you like the ""butter"" stuff they squirt on at the theater, that's a separate purchase.  You might want to consult your doctor.<br /><br />The 2.5 oz. packets are made for the baby-sized commercial-style machines, and they produce a smallish batch, about enough for one person.  I got one of these for Christmas, and now I wish I got a bigger model, at least a 4-oz. popper.  The little tub loses too many kernels during popping.  Plus, the small size makes it tough to clean and load the tub.  Anyway, the popcorn is great.  If you are an occasional popcorn eater, these packets are incredibly handy.  If you make a few batches a week, though, you might want to invest in a big tub of the oil and a box of flavacol, which should save money in the long run."	0	0
1	B007I7Z3Z0	A10PEXB6XAQ5XF	Good Taste and Easy to Mix	I drink a lot of flavored waters using the ready-to-mix packets, primarily the Crystal Light brand - I can't recall drinking a Lipton brand but, after drinking this one, I will add it to the list.<br /><br />This packet has a good flavor, although the blackberry (to me) had a hint of grape in it.  I mixed it in a 20 ounce bottle of cold water - the directions say use a 16.9 ounce bottle - and it still tasted just a bit too sweet to be called perfect.  The powdered mix is not as fine as Crystal Lite but a little thicker and coarse, so you will spend a little bit more time shaking the bottle in order to mix it properly.<br /><br />There are 10 calories per packet, even though the front of the box says 5 calories in big letters because each packet is two servings.  That's about the same as Crystal Light.  Overall, this one is pretty good and I think I will try out a few of their other flavors to add some variety.	0	0
1	B001P3NU30	A3RGRPLTOXKAAL	Vet student recommends!	I am a veterinary student and I can say I really love these chews for dogs.  They are much better quality ingredients than the rawhides in the grocery store and most dogs like them much more.  I can say from experience that my dog prefers them over those.  My dog is a medium size dog but I buy the large chews--they aren't too big and you get more for your money.  He eats them SO fast that I know he really likes them and I can feel better about the quality of what he is eating.  At the end of chewing on these, some dogs can try and swallow a piece that is too large because they are being over-zealous but as long as you keep an eye on them this shouldn't be a problem. (I think everyone who gives their dog a rawhide should be observing their dog anyway)  If you say this is a choking hazard, then so are every other rawhide chewables out there.  These are great for their teeth and they love to eat them, so what's not to like about the product?  I would highly recommend!	0	0

1	B008JKTH2A	A3BHAM17DVGWOF	Super healthy and not sugary sweet	I love these cereal bars...the mixed nuts with protein bars are my favorite. They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein. They are definitely very heavy on 'calories from fat' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar. The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts. LOVE IT.	1	0

They are very tasty but now that the price has gone sky high we will be savoring our last bag.<br />(UPDATE) Ordered these for xmas 2010 despite the price increase & they were terrible, soggy to the point of being almost rotten. I won't ever buy these again, such a shame, when they were good, they were very good.	1	0

1	B003M63CCW	A397JB9D917CKI	Response to the 2-star review...	"To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your ""wrathful"" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs."	4	0
1	B000GZYAN2	A1W5UOSPSVRHQJ	good and easy	They actually seem to vary by batch. Sometimes they are excellent and sometimes they lack a little flavor. I still like them and will continue to buy. I am at about 5,000 ft and have to do the high elevation recipe modification.	0	0
1	B007JFXWRC	A2OY6P98P87047	Lipton Herbal Pyramind Tea	During the cooler months, I love to drink a good cup of tea. But there's nothing worse than getting everything ready to find that your tea bag broke and your have leaves floating in your tea. So now with the Lipton Pyramid, you won't have that problem anymore. The pyramid itself is made of a mesh material that's very strong so it won't have a problem with breaking. And the tea itself is delicious. The flavor of it was very delicate and relaxing. Overall it's a much better way to brew tea.	0	0
1	B00153SS6E	A1Z77BZWQTRIBM	Very Pleased...	"My little Cowboy is very happy with Spot's Stew.  It took us a while to find a food that worked for his ""finicky"" tummy but a friend suggested we give it a try.  Her dog, Mr. Quiggs gives it ""two paws up.""  Full of real food and the end result is easy to scoop - hey, that rhymes with poop!  Cowboy will pick out the peas (yes, there are real peas in there) and eat the rest of the food first - either he saves the best for last or he really doesn't like peas.  I'm guessing the latter.  It's a big plus that the food can be delivered to my door - thanks Amazon."	0	0

1	B000F0Z0T6	A3NVZTGPORNPRW	Much more efficient than small bottles	I eat scandalous amounts of red pepper on various foods (pizza and chili mostly) and I have tried a lot of different brands.  Most are of questionable quality or contain too much fine powder that induces sneezing.  Tone's Red Pepper is the good stuff.  Look no further if you take your crushed red pepper seriously.  On a side note, you can probably find this stuff cheaper at most brick-and-mortar stores that sell things (like spices, candy, whatever) in bulk.  I sure did.	1	1
1	B0006ZN538	A2C0E8KC6EQQRW	Just ordered another bag!	We decided to eat wheat free a great decision so far. We have used almond flour in the past and found it a great product.

Consistency is same as traditional pastas... cooks, tastes and reheats just as well.  So much better for you too, being organic and whole wheat.  I am so pleased to have discovered this brand. I can't find it in local stores yet, so God bless amazon! We are big on healthy eating but also at having some kind of pasta at least once a week, so buying in bulk on amazon at a good price really suits our grocery buying purposes. So pleased that amazon offers so many organic choices that don't necessarily break the bank.  I buy local meat and produce from farmers, but for packaged organic foods, you can't beat amazon."	0	0
1	B002T12K24	A2OR8QYLG9WZ5M	Best, Authentic Flavor	"I bought the 4 oz. package of this last time, and compared flavors, as I'd also found some at an International Market. (We live in California and have a big Mexican foods section.) The grocery store brand was a few bucks cheaper, but we found ourselves using more to get the same amount of flavor. Also, the grocery store brand had more of an ""ashy"" flavor, as opposed to a good ""smokey"" flavor. So I'm getting the larger package this time. We add it to a ""Chipotle Potato Soup"" at The New Deli, and it's a hit."	1	0
-1	B000EZOKX4	A16KY8ZIQL6XGC	Now owned by Proctor and Gamble	FYI to anyone who loves their cat(s) and is feeding them this premium cat food thinking it is... Well it was just (very quietly) bought out by P&G. Either that means something to you or it doesn't. For me it was a deal breaker. Our cat loved this food, but I won't feed him a product owned by that company. They *say* they will keep it all the same, but you never know.<br /><br />We switched to Orijen.	6	3

No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. I use a spoonful in his dry food every night with some warm water to make it a little soupy for him. I like the ingredients, the way his coat looks, how he NEVER has bad breath or dog farts. Ever.	1	0
1	B005IW4WFY	A963RX20PGRO8	Health/junk food	This is a classic example of junk-food marketed as health food. Granted it's better than most junk-food so if your going to eat processed sugar treats this is better, but it's essentially a highly processed sugar and oat candy bar ground up - the other stuff listed in the ingredients are of such small quantities to be negligible. You can make oats+sugar at home with raw ingredients for much cheaper and more healthy. The one thing it has is crunch, which might be useful sprinkled on yoghurt or a replacement for sugar in your cereal (or oats) in small quantities. One bag contains 11 servings - if you actually make a bag last 11 days you're in the minority because most people will wharf it down and end up ingesting huge amounts of empty calories and consider it a good product, boy it sure tastes good. If Kind was serious about making a healthy oat-based cereal they would remove the 60 grams of sugar (more than a can of Coke).	0	1
1	B005GYULZY	A134K13HU8NBDB	My dogs are in love!	When I first saw this I wasn't to sure but I love to give my pups new things to try. When it came in I checked it out....it looks like a roll on deodorant. I had to laugh but then came the taste test. I think my dogs are in love with this! We have small dogs...all less than 6lbs and I have to roll the ball for them to get more flavor so it's not so bad but I imagine that larger dogs can roll the ball themselves. If you're looking for something new and different then you may want to give this one a try!	1	1

-1	B001VJ0B0I	A240FRPD4MEXND	Yorkie Somewhat Less Than Enthusiastic	Fifteen pounds of dog food -- and a Yorkie who suggests I keep it in the bag where it obviously belongs.  In her defense, I should add that this is a dog who has been raised on dry dog food (and the occasional bit of cat chow and hamburger when she can snag a morsel), so her opinion is not based on the difference between kibble and canned food.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, I am not surprised at her lack of enthusiasm.  The first ingredient is yellow corn meal, with corn gluten meal coming in at third place.  Chicken byproduct meal is also in the top ingredients.  And I'm still looking for real meat -- the kind that dogs go for.  Certainly, this product has lots of vitamins and minerals, plus fish oil, so there are ingredients to be pleased about, but, on the whole, those vitamins and minerals won't do much good if the dog goes on a hunger strike.  So it's back to the expensive stuff for this Yorkie.  Glad she doesn't eat like a Great Dane!	0	0

1	B005VOOM4A	AEL6CQNQXONBX	I am picky about my coffee but this is good stuff	This was the first time that I had tried any Marley Coffee but I really like it. It is certainly a high quality coffee and has an excellent flavor. I am a little picky about my coffee and usually stick to Starbucks Sumatra or Caff&eacute; Verona because I enjoy bolder and more flavorful coffee. Marley Coffee One Love blend is every bit as good as my favorite coffee and I really enjoy it. There are 15 single serve pods in this package and each pod is packed with plenty of coffee so it makes a great tasting cup of coffee. The pods and individually wrapped in foil so they stay very fresh and it makes them easy to store and carry with you.<br /><br />These pods are for a pod brewer not to be mistaken for a Keurig, Tassimo, CBTL or any other type of single serve coffee maker. I have noticed that some people are saying that these pods make week coffee and that just shouldn't be the case at all. They might be using them incorrectly or in the wrong type of machine if that is the case. The pods also tell you which side is up so maybe if you brew it backwards then it might make a difference but I honestly haven't tried it that way.	0	1

-1	B005K4Q4LK	A3LIHB4OPMZ8LS	Clogged up my Keurig	This stuff tastes great.  However, it is not really coffee.  It is a flavored drink on the order of hot cocoa.  It has a lot of calories (80 per cup) and sugar.  It also clogged up my Keurig big time.	1	1
-1	B007I7Z3Z0	A1AG7F4Z1EOO5L	tasty but not as flavorful as juice	I like the ease of the packaging of these to go packets and have also used these to make a liter of the tea at home using two packets.  I prefer my drinks to be sweetened naturally and glad to see these have honey rather than other sugar substitutes.  The flavor is a bit lacking when compared to juice but given that it is a tea, it's a good alternative to plain water or whenever you want a beverage which is low calorie and refreshing.	0	1
1	B000B7QMRW	AYOVMBKO4FI2H	This is the good stuff!	Very hot and perfect for toothpicks.  Great quality and the 4oz bottle will last a very long time.  The longer you let the wood suck in the oil the more flavor your will get out of it.  Don't let it sit on your lips too long.	1	0
1	B000G1EO4G	A3VKBFC5K2INR4	Full of Flavor!	What an awesome surprise this soup was. I have  been a long term customer of Amy's. I have tried many of their vegan wraps, burritos, and frozen prepared dinners. Nothing from this company had been disappointing. This soup only has 120 calories for the entire can so i figured what i lost in calories would also be lost in taste. I was very wrong. It is full of a variety of veggies and a nice flavor. I add some dried oregano just to top it off. I haven't purchased this off amazon but i know it is much cheaper here than in stores. I plan on ordering this off here when i move so i have more room for all these cans. I highly recommend this to anyone. It is a healthy vegan-friendly organic soup.	0	0

1	B000G7UDPY	A3EWJX7W1X7E79	Baxter's canned soups rule!	This was actually a gift to my daughter (along with 3 cases of other Baxter's soups). She's of the opinion that Baxter's is absolutely the BEST canned soup on the Planet (of the soups she's tasted, which include the major American brands - she doesn't cook much). The Lobster Bisque rated just below Baxter's Scottish Smoked Salmon (which she rated the BEST EVER). (From my own perspective, and usually cooking my own food, I have to admit that the Baxter's soup line, for canned soup, is superior).	1	0

1	B001IZM92S	A2QG0KKKVFD2AB	I can't describe how much I love these apple chips!	I don't eat flour or sugar products so my choices are quite limited. Plus, I have many chemical sensitivities. I use an ounce of these chips with frozen fruit I whip into a smoothie-like substance and it's pure nirvana!<br /><br />I know people have complained about a musty smell or flavor. Well, maybe it's because I don't eat much processed food, but these chips are so sweet and fulfilling for a snack-type food and I would definitely have noticed such a smell.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because I do think I have a slight reaction to them (eczema that worsens if I use them too many days in a row).<br /><br />But getting the bulk price has saved me a fortune. They are close to $4 for an ounce in Publix or Whole Foods.	2	0
1	B004R8J8E0	A2E9HDZXQORZLA	Quick and Easy Way to Spice Up a Meal	For anyone who wants a quick and easy meal or to doctor up a plain piece of pork or chicken, Shake 'N Bake is a classic. For me, it's the fastest, most reliable way to bake a pork chop or piece of chicken and not have it come out of the oven looking either like beef jerky or a leather jacket.<br /><br />Yeah...not really known for my culinary abilities.<br /><br />No fuss, no muss, no bother baking is what Shake 'N Bake is all about. And it tastes good, too. This classic was like a blast from my younger years, and it left my bone-in chops just as juicy and moist as I could hope for them to be. The flavor is bold enough not to require further seasoning - and for a salt lover like me, that's saying something - and the breading mostly stayed nice and crisp throughout. I was completely satisfied by the Shake 'N Bake pork, and glad they've revived the old classic. I have every intention of adding this one to my dinner rotation.	0	0

-1	B003Z6ZGZK	A2IHDSWGOJBZ2Q	Great product. super slow shipping	This product, Starbucks Via, is a Starbucks Product. It's good stuff.  I live in Seattle, the home of Starbucks.  This price was cheaper than anywhere I've found for this quantity so I ordered.  I thought it would take a few days to get here in a plastic envelope.  Nope, 12 (TWELVE) days later it arrived and was shipped from Tennessee with a packing slip with the official starbucks maiden on the invoice.  Come on, Starbucks, Does all of your roasted coffee ship to your coffee shops from the same location.....no distribution centers or anything that could mail a package a little more efficiently.  12 days from time of order to receipt is a long time for a package.

1	B003FWH170	AHO0FAI4KMBPX	Vegetarian Gummies - Yea!	As a vegetarian, one of the few things I hated giving up was gelatin products.  It's amazing how many foods have it in it, some really surprising.  Gummy candies are almost always made with it and generally they're full of artificial colors and artificial flavors as  well - both things I avoid at all costs!  These have none of those cruddy ingredients and best of all, they're delicious!  I gave my meat-eating, vegetarian-scoffing son some and didn't tell him they were vegetarian.  He LOVED them and refused to believe me that they didn't have all that junk until I ate them.  That shut him up fast!<br /><br />We both love them although he'll never admit it!	0	0

1	B001AQVQL0	AWLAURP772GW	Fantastic Protein Shake	I have to rely on protein shakes to meet my protein quota of 80 grams a day.  I tell you this product makes it very easy to meet my goals.  IT TASTES GREAT!  I love Lean Body's shakes and this is the best of them all.  I usually would not reach for Vanilla flavored anything...just chocolate.  I tried this one because it was all that was left in the gym and now I know I had been missing out.  This is the best protein shake and ...it is filling, full of nutrition, and has 40g of protein.  It is low in carbs also.  I was once an EAS Advantedge user.  This has double the protein and taste.  Warning: the air bubbles that may form while you are drinking can make you feel like something is in your drink but it is just an air bubble.  Also, it tastes good when is served cold.	1	0

1	B007JT7AEY	A3BAE79NXFDXGV	I enjoyed the results and scent of this shampoo.	Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner works.  The bottle I received to try was a bit damaged from the shipping.  What was left of the product I tried was very effective.  After using it for a couples of days, the flakes disappeared and my hair looked very good.  I'm very pleased with the results and I can't wait to buy a bottle (when mine runs out).  So, if you're looking for a very effective anti-dandruff shampoo then look no further than Clear Men Scalp Therapy.  Your hair will look good and smell great.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.	0	0

What this means for me is what used to be a 4 Weight Watchers Points Plus breakfast, is now 5 points. Sure it's only 1 points, but the taste isn't as good any more.<br />In the ingredients list one notable difference is that there is now less dark chocolate chunks, but more sugar.<br /><br />All in all, I wish they would go back to the old recipe. It's still good, but not as great as before.<br /><br />---- Earlier review: (5/9/11) ----<br />This is a chewy delicious granola bar that is pretty sweet but not overly so because it has dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate.<br />The almonds give it a nice crunch, and there is a peanut-butter-like layer on the bottom, and I dont even like peanut butter that much and I love it.<br /><br />I'm on the Weight Watcher Points Plus and I was looking for a nice filling granola bar that I can either eat as a breakfast bar, or as dessert, and it fits both perfectly, and at 4 points per bar, I still have enough points to eat a good portion lunch or dinner.<br /><br />I highly recommend it so much that I'm going to get an amazon subscription for it!	1	0

When I came across these canisters at this great price, I immediately ordered it.<br /><br />It's a satisfying hot chocolate which has only 25 calories and comes out to just pennies a serving.  I highly recommend it.	0	0

I've tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations. I love that they are organic. My only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when I got mine in the mail, one of the jars was broken and I had to clean the food off of the other bottles.	0	0

But for now please be advised before you purchase------- I read the reviews - Lots of dented cans....  I figured there were so many complaints that it just couldn't still be happening, right?  WRONG!  6 of the 12 were badly dented all along the upper rim seams.  Amazon did, however, make good on my order with an exchange.  Still----- disappointing that the product quality control is so poor with this product after all the bad reviews.	0	0
1	B00433JTPC	AY12DBB0U420B	Looking For More.	These dried mangos are excellent. I picked them up at Costco and was hesitant because the bag was so large. False problem. These Philippine Brand dried mangos are excellent. Perhaps they might be a little higher in sugar than I would like, but they really taste good. They're nice and chewy and have excellent, although highly variable from piece to piece, flavor. Good product. I'm down to the bottom of the bag and looking for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson	1	0

Other unrefined coconut oils I tried have a slightly greasy aftertaste.

I'm sorry I forgot all about this little gem and to tell you all how much I enjoyed it.<br />I purchased just ONE single bar when I saw it available and thought I would try it and let me tell you, it surprised me all the way.<br /><br />Absolutely delicious, and so fresh tasting with just the right texture and flavor; the right chewiness and sweet-tartness. And combining with chia seeds is so unique and it added something extra to it that I wouldn't have thought of.<br /><br />If someone wants to gift me a box for Christmas (cranberry), that would be just awesome! :)	0	0
1	B001J9ST90	A360104XRFH2SE	My dogs LOVE these!	"Yes, these chews are a little expensive for consumables, but if you don't have dogs of destruction they'll last for a while. My first dog would find his occasionally and work on it for a while, then lose interest again. They'd last several weeks.<br /><br />Now that we've introduced a second dog they go three times as fast; the new dog likes them too, and now the ""trophy"" factor comes into play. As soon as one dog has one, the other becomes intensely interested in stealing it for themselves even if they walked right over it 2 minutes before. :D These are a staple at our house."	3	0

1	B000GPM9IK	A5G977UGFTVT1	Best pre-workout mix	I used to workout when i played baseball, but after i stopped playing i gained a lot of weight. We recently decided to change our lifestyle before we have kids so we can be there for them and do the things parents need to do.<br /><br />Over the years i've tried many different products and this is the best tasting pre-workout mix that actually works. My pumps are harder and i can go longer. I've gained a lot of weight and i need to get back in shape - so for the past 3 weeks i've used this as a pre-work out mix before my workouts and muscle milk light after my workouts. I've been using this, muscle milk light and amazing grass (vegetable/fruit drink mix) as breakfast. 3.5oz of steak or chicken for lunch and a normal dinner (usually before 6). I've lost 22 pounds in 3 weeks and my wife can tell a huge difference in the way i look. I have not been doing any cardio - just strictly lifting. We just bought an elliptical this week so i plan to start that soon as well. I'm amazed at the results so far and plan to continue.<br /><br />I highly recommend this workout mix to anyone wanting to build lean muscle.	0	0

1	B000FFLHSY	A105981PIJDJUU	live healthy	I put the Goji berries into my hot steel cut oat cereal to soften them a little bit. The knowledge of having something totally unprocessed makes it even more appealing. If you never had them, they taste like a combination of raisins and cranberries.	13	1
-1	B0034EDMCW	A3E44J6UX651BC	Horrible tasting and WAY overpriced and may break your teeth.	I was looking for a healty snack and these got good reviews. My first impression was that these are very small and extremely bland tasting. The almonds were slightly soft and did not thaste very much like almonds, but it was edible. The second bar had a spot that tasted really bad as if one of the nuts were bad. The third bar was ok, but then it was almost every bar after that was bad. I ended upo throwing the last few bars away. The packaging was sealed properly and it was well within it's expiration date. These bars also have a way of twisting your teeth around to the point I thought I might have damaged one of my teeth. If you want an equally healthy snack for a better price, pick up a bag of mixed nuts/trail mix from your grocery store.	0	6
1	B00141WDXG	A2UVATCLGYKFV3	GREAT results with continued use at the prescribed dosage!	My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order.	0	0

She has a tendency to turn her nose up at most of the ""healthy"" choices, but she absolutely devoured this one. Several months later, she is still loving it and practically licks the bowl clean!  It has made a world of difference in her energy level, her coat is shiny and it has cut down on the amount of waste in the litter box.  The ingredients are all natural and my vet recommended this as one of the top choices of wet food for my cat.<br /><br />The food is in smaller size chunks with a LOT of gravy.  The pouch is easy to rip open, or can be cut. I highly recommend it as a healthy choice and for your finicky feline :)"	1	0
1	B0001590KU	A2Q1ELWEHTTTF5	My favorite chutney.	Anyone who grew up in South Africa loves Mrs. Balls Chutney. I have been living in the USA for twenty years and have tried many chutneys, including many from local Indian Groceries and home-made varieties from speciality stores. Nothing quite beats the taste of this brand. I know many recipes that use this chutney to make a wonderful marinade, or sauce for chicken dishes as well. These recipes can be found on line. I was delighted to find that Amazon had listed this incredible product. I bought six bottles and as soon as they are finished, I know where I can find them again. Either the Regular or the Peach varieties are a family favorite, even amongst my American born children. Thank you Amazon.	9	0
1	B000MT4HWG	A1IPA6LP1KAT6	Excellent treats and made in the USA	I've tried all three (and yes, the Salmon is fishy smelling and a bit greasy) and the dogs love them all. It is hard to find dog treats worth buying that are made in the USA that don't cost a fortune. These are reasonable. Don't be fooled by companies that are based in the US but the actual manufacture is in a country not to be named. I also will buy treats made in Canada. I think most pet stores, including ones like Petsmart and Petco are charging way too much for DOG TREATS. I found mine at a human health food store (Fruitful Yield) and was surprised at the cost. Now I see I can order all three from Amazon, shipped for a comparable price. Just wish I could order items in the US and have them shipped from Amazon to say England or Australia. Would love to easily send these to my friends' dogs.	1	0

For those familiar with Pu-erh, it tastes very similar to Xia Guan 2004 100 gram toucha in my opinion.  I love that tea as well.  They both offer a sweet green taste with enough of a ""bite"" that you notice it.  I would recommend this tea highly to those looking for a really unique green tea experience.  As a side note, it is obviously much cheaper than buying a slightly aged pu-erh toucha."	0	0
1	B000FFLTDM	ADIHIVQWXQOZ5	Experiment	"I have tried several Dr. McDougall's Vegan soups with three different microwaves.  The time needed in each has been quite different - from needing less (to avoid boiling over) to needing more.  The soup should to be very hot but not hot enough to boil over.  I believe many complaints of ""chewy"" pasta/noodles/veggies is probably from unwillingness to experiment with cooking and standing times."	1	0
-1	B001LGGH40	A3IFKBUE064H5V	Overly sweet	This drink wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It's supposed to be Kiwi floavord but the  it doesn't quite make what it's going for. It does have a sweet fruit juice flavor and is carbonated as the description describes, but somehow they don't blend well together. I think kids would like the flavor.

BFF's tuna & veggies is a bit different from Weruva's - it has red tuna instead of white and a slightly thicker consistency, though both are stew like and have visible chunks of veggies.

She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!	6	0

1	B000KV7ZGQ	A2KEO97THIOBRZ	very good treat dispenser	This is my dogs favorite toy. I got this last summer for my very anxious, smart 2 year old pit bull rescue to keep him occupied while working. He is very destructive to his toys but doesn't eat what he destroys. He spends an hour or more a day playing with it , not including while we aren't home. At first I fed him only from this toy, but now he's calmer so I feed him in his bowl too, but he generally prefers to feed out of the toy. I knew when buying he would chew the plastic rope off immediately, and he did. Some come with a nylon rope, which would take longer to chew off. Since I have the large, and the rope is gone, I put in one or more large treats (depending on how hard to dispense I want to make it) and regular size hard dog food and a few small treats that will fit through the neck. The rope definitely blocks well and can be replaced; for me it was easier to put a larger dog treat in to block. With the rope I needed to use small bite dog food because it came out very slowly, and he would lose interest.  Interestingly he loves the enlarged end of the plastic rope to chew on (not good for swallowers). Very sturdy and easy to fill as long as you line up the spirals. He's never opened it. He knocks it around with his paws and nose and grabs the neck with his mouth and throws it around. So far no damage, but it is sturdy and could possibly break something when tossed. Worth the slight risk. After almost 8 months he began to chew off the plastic ring around the neck, which he loved doing, and does attract him to the neck where the treats come out. Recently he started chewing the neck off, which is why I'm buying another, but I plan on using this one until he gets down to where the neck is gone, as it still works and he still loves it.	0	0

Favorite use is for our treatment of tofu which we freeze first, wring out and then spray with sesame oil and sprinkle it with Lawry's Garlic Salt and bake it till it's like crispy garlic bread and then we try not to pass out from gastronomic ecstasy when we eat it as a snack or with meals.	0	0

1	B0005XN9HI	A29XKBTWTBD32C	Smarter Tomato Paste	I saw on one of the cooking shows where they used Tomato Paste in a tube.  I liked the idea.  Most of the time my recipe doesn't call for a lot of Tomato Paste.  Even the small cans available at the grocery store are too much and I end up wasting the unused portion.  This product in a tube allows me to use the amount I wish and save the balance.  In addition this is a very good product.	0	0
-1	B004984G40	A39NT16G4DO6CZ	Unpleasant aftertaste!	The chocolate Svelte flavor is good until two seconds after you drink it. The Stevia flavor is an unpleasant surprise that lingers. I needed the protein from the drink and was filled up by it. However, I felt like I was forcing down every swallow and dreaded the aftertaste. Cute designs but I guess I'll have to try some other flavors and see if it can mask the Stevia.	2	2
-1	B000F0DW0U	A3KG5Q302QXSCD	Good crunch but CANNOT pass off as homemade	"I bought this with the intent of eating it straight from the box when I'm busy at school and thought it'd be stovetop stuffing quality.  In other words I wasn't expecting the world and that I'd know it would be a bit dry.  I also knew that the recipe for making falafel was dead easy.  But reading all the positive reviews I felt, ""well why not"".  I need to be  brutally honest and say the only thing worthwhile about this mix is the crunch.  Otherwise it is similar to eating glorified sawdust when prepared as instructed and will never pass as homemade falafel as per another reviewer's commentary.  Honestly homemade isn't hard if you have the kitchenaid hand blender, but the convenience factor was something I was really interested in.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Crunch<br />Convenience<br />Ease<br />Can be baked<br /><br />Cons:<br />Flavour and texture is like sawdust (must soak at least 30 minutes though that won't fix it)<br /><br />Because I had the version from Mediterranean Cafe east of Los Angeles (Pasadena to be specific) one might think I'm picky, but honestly they could have at least tasted what they created and said that you needed to add fresh cilantro, parsley and onion to compensate the texture of the dry mix.  I actually had to guess what was missing then, with a receipe online, and make a brand new batch of falafel from hand in order to fix the flavor and inside texture of this one and my family and I still think it's weird.<br /><br />Simply put if this is the best of the box falafels I'd stay the heck away from all else.  If you feel the same way and you're stuck with 12 boxes, what you can do to fix it is to add some cilantro, onion and garlic until it develops the falafel greenish hue.  I did this and it was definitely much much closer to the falafel I had.  Perhaps I should also add breadcrumbs but a part of me goes ""is this honestly necessary!?  Why am I REMAKING falafel?""<br /><br />IMO if convenience is ruined by forcing one to remake the item they're supposed to imitate the product fails.  I am therefore giving one star for the crunch only."	4	4

1	B005Q8IXXM	A2SSV6KM3W1VFD	This product is different.	This product is different. I am thinking carefully as I write this to explain why. It tastes great. The real cocoa in it makes a real difference in flavor on the positive side. I plan to use this for making great healthy milkshakes in the hot desert this summer. I will buy this again but to be honest Im not sure if its really great for muscle recovery or not. Tried it after running with my dogs and hard several times and didn't feel much difference. However it is tasty,  I believe it provides nutriants and is not a waste of money. I will buy this again. Something I liked about it is it is lighter then a product like Ensure so for me was easier to get down when not truely  hungry. Have a happy painfree healthy day  *smile	0	0

1	B0016COPSY	A23AZWJN07QGQE	Great Healthy on-the-go & Portable!	I've tried this as well as many of the other choices, and they've all been good. The veggies are healthy and if you get one with beans & rice, the tuna or the salmon (which I haven't tried yet), you'll get a balanced meal. The best part? They all come with a plastic-covered small fork, salt & pepper and a gourmet sauce that's different for almost each variety.<br /><br />I rarely have time to make myself food to take with me, and being busy AND a diabetic, it's important that I have something to eat when I need it. This way, I'm not stuck eating junk or not getting enough to keep me going for awhile.<br /><br />The ONLY negative comment I have is that the cardboard box which covers the meal is rather flimsy, and also is open on the sides. So in a bag that's moving around, it sometimes can come apart, and then you have to search for the fork and condiments in your bag. Put it in a plastic bag so that you can easily find the items if it comes apart.	1	1
-1	B001TM2A3I	A35PBTOYQKRI0P	bad choice	Was told by an employee in a pet store that this brand is one of the best. Bought from them and then purchased at Amazon (cheaper).

1	B004R8J8E0	A3H8PA7AG48K33	Go With Your Taste Buds	Although the packaging is labeled for Pork, this flavor of Shake and Bake goes well with chicken as well.  Nothing could be easier.  Mix the seasoning with your meat and bake.  You get the fried meat flavor without all the oil and mess of deep frying.  It can be a little on the salty side, so you may want to moderate the size of the meat.  The spice blend complements, but does not overwhelm the meat flavor.	1	0

1	B0051COPH6	A2DB720I9XRX7K	It's watery; baby likes it with cereal	"I've been getting pouches like these for my eight month old grandson, and he hasn't learned to suck them out of the bag yet like so many others have reported. He really prefers to eat only finger food that he can pick up and isn't keen at all on being spoon fed anymore, so I have to kind of distract him to get him to let me spoon the food. The very thin ones like this he will only eat if they have some texture to them, so I squeeze it out into a bowl and add baby oatmeal or baby brown rice cereal. The flavor is good; this one isn't so sweet as some of the apple-pea, etc ones I've tried. I don't have him too often (and he doesn't eat these for his parents), so I may not be able to use them up before expiration. Actually, though, I like them well enough to eat them myself, so I just toss a couple in my car (though I actually think this one tastes better cold), and I have veggies for when I am out and about. These packets are four and a half ounces, considered two servings for baby at 40 calories each, and 2 grams of fiber. They are a good source of Vitamin C (70%) and also have Vitamin A (25%). I am pleased with this combo, and would like to try more of their ""advanced stages"" products with more texture. Hope this helps.<br /><br />*update: he has learned to sip the puree out of the pouch now and seems to be enjoying it more. I have to supervise, though, because he will sip a bit and then try to play with the pouch, and it will quite easily drip out of the top if he gets it upside down. Just letting him take some sips, then put it away and offer more later."	0	0

1	B000J36M4Q	A2X9NU2VE0S01P	Great all by themselves	These San-J Black Sesame Rice Crackers are so good that I just eat them by themselves. I also like the San-J sesame brown rice made with regular sesame seeds instead of black sesame seeds, but like these black sesame variety a bit more. They are especially helpful for me if I'm too busy to eat in general (I need to be relaxed usually), but I can digest these with no problem and eat them while working at the computer, and the sesame seeds give more nutritional value. They have a lot of sesame seeds on them.<br /><br />I just wish Amazon still sold them directly (preferably in Subscribe & Save) at a cheaper price. This price is out of my range, even before shipping is added. I know that I got the San-J sesame brown rice variety by the case from Amazon in summer 2009 for about $35 (free shipping), but the only ones sold now by Amazon (in Fall 2010) seem to be the plain tamari rice crackers (no sesame). Will have to keep searching to replenish my pantry with them at a better price.	1	1

-1	B000IYYRXO	A1YAZ4SM29KI01	Very Bitter Tasting Caffe D'Vita Sugar Free	I wish I had read all the reviews prior to ordering this stuff.  I wanted to switch to sugar free for lower calories, but wow did I get the bitter end of the taste doing that.  This stuff is terrible if you want a sweet tasting product.  No amount of sweetner can help and now I'm out the money for a product that I can't return....that isn't right.  If bought at a store they would take the unopened items back. Guess I'll have to donate it. If you want good tasting sugar free french vanilla cappuccino then order Victorian Inn.  At least theirs isn't bitter like this stuff by Caffe D'Vita.  Regular Caffe D'Vita is good, sugar free is bad very very bad.	0	0

1	B002IEZJMA	A2WN1QF8GSVHYV	Strong espresso flavor with a hint of milk	Strong espresso taste with a hint of mil, but a tiny bit bitter for me, yet not as much as the cappuccino flavor. If you like a little bitterness, then you'll prolly love this. Thankfully no can taste, which was a concern of mine. I prefer a bit more milk in mine (soy or rice).<br /><br />Otherwise not much to say - plain, no flavors, although I'm sure you could add your own if you want i, but taste fine just like it is.<br /><br />The bitterness was just a hint, which many regular espresso drinkers probably wouldn't notice - for me, it was enough to take off a star, but was still good. Don't know that I'll be buying a lot of it, but for that allergy or headache, when I use that caffeine, it would be great to have around to get rid of those.	1	1

Well, there's a strong ""hint"" of peanut butter, but they definitely could've increased the taste.<br /><br />Also, it didn't get soggy at all...in fact it didn't even soften up!  Barely absorbed any milk. That was a little bit of a disappointment actually.  I like my cereals to soften up a little and I like to taste the milk in them (it kinda felt like I was eating cereal out of the box and then taking a sip of milk after :-)  Not a real problem though.  Still delicious.<br /><br />I tried having them with fresh bananas (as the box picture suggests) and that was fabulous!<br /><br />The Best part is that the ingredients are so awesome!! I hate cereals with 5 kinds of sugar and weird chemicals.  This tasted great and wasn't unhealthy.  I recommend it!"	1	0

I cut open the bag and was knocked back back a beautiful and incredibly tempting coffee aroma!<br />This had a really good flavor, nice and full, not bitter.<br />After trying it at 10oz, i then re-brewed (@6oz) the same pack to fill my 16oz cup.<br />The filter held up extremely well and the coffee still tasted delicious and not watered down.<br />There were no chunks of bean in my cup as I finished, some fine powdery grounds, but I get more when i double brew a k-cup.<br /><br />So pluses:<br />Coffee tastes good<br />Slightly less trash than a K-Cup<br />A WHOLE LOT cheaper than K-Cup<br />Organic<br />Sealed into small quantity packs<br />To be able to smell your coffee beans<br />Multiple roast strengths and decaf are available.<br />Did I mention it tastes good?<br /><br />Cons:<br />Still pricier than bulk coffee<br />Sealed in 8 count pouches, so if you don't drink frequently you will have to re-vacuum.<br />Storage, it is a little more inconvenient than being able to stack the k-cups in the drawer, but I have plenty of room.<br />No selection of flavored coffees (yet, according to their website they are coming soon)<br /><br />I applaud the manufacturer for improving on the k-cup, and for producing a finely roasted bean!<br />I cannot remember the last time I actually thanked a company for their product, but I will now!<br />Thank You San Francisco Bay Coffee!<br />You have a new fan!	1	0

I've been pleasantly surprised by the taste.  I do like the Van whatever flavor French Vanilla K-cups, and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee.<br />I would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees, you'll most likely enjoy this one.

-1	B001EQ5NJM	A2L01339XV496V	Do not know WHAT I expected	Since my family loves Spam (fried for sandwiches) I thought I would try this product for a change of pace. Not sure, really, what I expected but was not sold on this at all. Did not have the taste of regular Spam but did not have the taste of roasted turkey either. Not sure what it tasted like. I proceeded to prepare it as I always do for sandwiches....heated up a non-stick skillet and sliced the product. Now I realize that this product is leaner than the regular Spam, and having said that I know now that I should have sprayed the skillet with a non-stick spray such as Pam. The product stuck to the pan like crazy and I was not able to fry it up evenly. This gave the procuct a mushy texture that was not pleasing. If you try it make sure you spray your pan first to avoid the sticking. Again, while eating it I was trying to figure out what it tasted like......still not sure. Had origianlly gotten this on subscribe and save but I thinkl I will cancel and just remain with the old standby..the original.	8	0

It makes a *perfect* dark and stormy when mixed with Gosling's or Kraken rum and a squeeze of lime. Without the rum to cut it, it can be a bit biting. Yes, that's right, it's better when you cut it with booze. That's how snappy it is.	6	0

1	B004E4CCSQ	A3RMS65F4GT4ML	Pleasant enough peachy taste	"I tried this drink this past week, just putting one squeeze into 8 ounces of water at first. The colored liquid didn't seem to be dissipating, so I stirred with a straw. When I took a drink, it was a very light, subtle peach flavor. Pleasant. After I drank about half the glass, I had to try another squeeze to see what it would do. Better.<br /><br />I appreciated the seal at the top of the bottle, which when you tear it, twirls around the bottle until you reach the perforation. Regarding the instructions, though: Wasn't sure what ""Flip It"" meant at first -- was I supposed to shake the bottle? (I did.) But it means flip the lid of the bottle. Of course, from a marketing perspective, I understand the need to be catchy / pithy! The ""click it twice to lock tight"" instruction on the label is also interesting -- normally, the user would just close the lid, which is what you do here, and perhaps not notice that there are two clicks. If you do just one click, it's obvious it's not closed all the way.<br /><br />I appreciate that it's sugar-free with no calories, along with caffeine-free. For sweetening, it uses Splenda (sucralose) rather than Nutrasweet (aspartame), which I also appreciate."	0	0

The Chocolate Towers arrived in plenty of time for the holidays & were very well packaged.<br />I thought the towers were slightly smaller than the picture portrayed but, since they were given to friends as a small Christmas token, they were fine.  The recipients expressed their delight & advised the chocolate was very good.  I'm not sure they would have advised if they weren't.  I should've ordered one for myself so I would've been able to judge for myself.  Will definitely consider doing that next year.	2	0

Crackers for only 12 calories? This would make the perfect snack to keep me from eating all day!""  The talk show host tried one & was saying how much he liked them so I figured they couldn't be all that bad...well, after tasting them I think he's full of you-know-what!  They are VERY dry & flavorless & not in a good way.<br /><br />I thought they would be a little less tasty than the high fiber crackers at the store, but no...they're way worse, but I guess that should be expected at just 12 calories.  First I tried them with laughing cow blue cheese & the flavors didn't go well at all.  Then I tried them with veggie dip (made with 16oz light sour cream & 1 pack of Cugino's veggie weggie dip mix).  This was at least edible.  I have some PB2 on order to try it with & update my review if it's better.<br /><br />Right now, I wouldn't buy them again, but at least I only paid $6.69 for a 5-pack through Amazon with subscribe & save & a $3 coupon."	0	0

-1	B004PX9JPA	A1KIMTH867KAPC	Lied to about amount of Slim Jims	The box says pack of 24 but I only received 23 in the box. I recounted it 4 times. It really ticks me off because of the lack of professionalism in packaging. Worst part, I can't find a way to get my money back or get in contact with them to state my case. It's only 1 missing slim jim so it's not a big deal, I hate being lied to and ripped off. This also makes me wonder, are all the boxes only containing 23 but states 24? That's false advertisement. Regardless, not satisfied and wouldn't buy again.	0	7
-1	B004AHBMJW	A2MTAFJI8FIKN6	Splinters easily. GI vs Ranger Rib	I bought a box of these on another website. They were much larger than I expected, some pieces were much thinner than others. My dog got through most of the ranger rib within 30 minutes. She is still chewing on some of the pieces that have splintered off.<br /><br />The only worry I have is that the splintered pieces are just that. Thin, sharp, oddly shaped pieces. Even the main bulk of the bone after having split was very sharp looking. I would suggest to monitor your dog, especially if you have one that is known to not chew their food very well, or will get in a rush in the presence of another dog and swallow pieces before being well chewed. Swallowing these sharp pieces could be very dangerous and has me monitoring my dog very closely when she chews on these ranger ribs.<br /><br />I previously bought the Merrick GI bones. The bone is much thicker and does not splinter. One bone for her has lasted her (collie/hound mix) for more than a month and she has barely cracked the bone. Other breeds, her roommate the american bulldog/lab mix makes it look easier to crack the GI bone, but she practically devours the ranger rib very quickly.<br /><br />I would consider buying the ranger ribs only on a treat basis. MAYBE once a week if at that. They get eaten up way too fast. Although they are much cheaper than the GI bones, I don't believe they are worth buying if you want a bone that will last.	2	0

1	B003Z6ZGZK	A3SYJR1HDV113W	Expiration dates - Seriously, ignore them.	"A lot of people have been posting about the near-expired dates on the coffee. First, I'd like to mention that this product is intentionally labeled to have a really short shelf-life, and not to ensure freshness.<br /><br />The funny thing about expiration dates is that for something like this, it honestly doesn't matter. I've gotten batches that are expired (for cheaper) and the taste is the same great amazing taste as it was when it was well within the ""Best Until"" range. Yes, I have taken two packs, one expired and one not expired, and they both are the same delicious taste.<br /><br />The reality is that expiration dates are a wonderful tool that make people throw perfectly fine food and go out and buy more. Especially with dairy products: If it's a few days over, most people will toss out cartons of perfectly good milk or eggs that could keep for another five weeks, which keeps people buying it more frequently. The fact is, if you would drink it without knowing the expiration date is past (it doesn't smell or look bad) then it's not only safe to eat, but a waste to toss.<br /><br />This isn't true for drugs, however. If your medicine says it's expired, it's expired. Also, condoms. Those do lose integrity over time.<br /><br />So, this is a product that intentionally has a very short shelf-life because it makes ridiculous people go, ""Oh, no, instead of getting it cheaper online and in bulk, I'll just buy a lot of more expensive smaller packs for more money."" Starbucks enjoys charging their consumers for their instant coffee like it's magical pixie dust, and the only way they can stop people from buying it from other cheaper sources is to give it a tiny shelf-life. Look at some of the other reviews, here. It's working!"	117	27

She is a picky eater, and sometimes the other food, has to be put in the refrigerator because I don't want it to spoil. I don't give her this ""flavor"" all the time though, because I want it to be more of a reward type meal.

-1	B004E4HUMY	A306153FTKS9PL	Absolutely artificial. But it tastes good.	"I have a hard time understanding who this product is for. My best guess is that it's somebody who wants to appear healthy and ""drinks water"" but doesn't actually like the flavorless quality of water. Like bottled flavored water beverages, this product adds flavor with no calories.<br /><br />But in the process, it adds chemical ingredients to your water. Propylene glycol, sucralose (artificial sweetener) and acesulfame potassium (also noted as a sweetener). I'm not saying any of these, in the quantities ingested using this product, are bad...but it seems odd to me to take water and add something to it that contains chemicals.<br /><br />The benefit is that you get flavoring without any calories. Does this product taste like ""sweet tea""? Yes, it does. I've been using it for over a week about once a day, and I would say it tastes like sweet tea. However, I've noticed a mild ""alcohol"" scent from it (probably the popylene glycol). The scent is very similar to that of any ""extract"" you probably have in your baking cabinet, like vanilla extract.<br /><br />The flavor is sweet without being incredibly artificial, due to no real sugar being in the product. The color is dead-on ""tea"" -- it's the right shade of brown, and just like tea, if you want more flavor and squeeze more of this into your water, it will get darker. It's an interesting concept.<br /><br />So what you end up with is a sweet-tea-flavored water...which lacks all of the benefits of actually drinking tea. Tea, after all, is healthy for you. There's no caffeine in this product and no sugar, so it doesn't offer any type of energy boost.<br /><br />It's artificial in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Personally, this isn't something I would use long-term. It has a good flavor and is convenient (small enough to keep in my desk drawer at work), but it doesn't quite fit into my overall nutrition goals. I would rather reach for a bottle of diet iced-tea before using this as a substitute."	0	0

Well, I was pleasantly surprised today to have the familiar pink and purple packaging catch my attention from the corner of my eye today.  I bought a bag, wondering if they still tasted the same.  A couple of the cookies were smaller than I remember, but they taste exactly the same:  Perfect.  If you have never had them, I highly recommend you give them a try.

-1	B002NHYQAS	A37DXIENIDHTVY	Pretty dang bad	In the last year or so I've really developed a taste for dark chocolate. I've liked dark chocolate for years but I started eating a bit more recently. I've tried several different brands from the store. All were at least good with some being a little better than others.<br /><br />So. While not scientific my personal taste experience says this dark chocolate bar taste terrible.<br /><br />If you are looking for that silky smooth deep rich dark chocolate flavor that sort of infuses your whole body starting with the tongue and culminating in a very pleasing feeling in your nogging look elsewhere. My God.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are really into organics and go out of your way to eat all things organic then perhaps this is your chocolate bar. 54% is not a very dark bar and I think it shows in the taste of this bar. The taste could also be due to the organic nature of the bar. That being the case, if you prefer that organic experience, that taste that organics typically have I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For everyone else, the flavor is off with strange undertones. Not inedible just not very tasty.<br /><br />The bars are fairly small at 2.25 ounces. That isn't really a knock since moderation in all things is a good habit.	1	2

1	B0034L4YGI	A3ET5FDBUNVBXP	Still trying to decide if I like the flavor	I'll give these 4* for now, because I love everything except the flavor.  The protein in these shakes is very high quality.  It's a mix of 7 different components and the predominant one is whey.  Perfect for drinking after a workout.  Amazingly, they have no sugar and are pretty low in fat.<br /><br />For the Cookies & Cream, I'm still on the fence about the flavor.  I love the Vanilla and I've been drinking 4-5 of them per week for years.  The Cookies & Cream tastes as advertised when it goes down.  But the aftertaste has a kind of bite to it that's hard to describe.  I suspect I'll get used to it and keep ordering this flavor for variety.  But it won't replace my staple Vanilla.	0	0
1	B008JKTH2A	A321W4SSC0F6AP	Good for you, tasty, but gooey	"I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their ""blueberry pieces"" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks"	1	0

1	B0019LA5TU	A2LCFD6YBPEDV8	Delicious	Ordered these specifically to use with our soymilk maker.<br />Soybean quality is high, no pebbles or dirt.

1	B000CR008I	A1TDFKLNXMXU4B	Ohhhhh, so that's a stick...	"didn't know what the diff was between the ""sticks"" and the the ""rods"" because when I was little (yes, I really was little... a long, long time ago) I used to go to the ""candy store"" and buy two pretzels or pretzel sticks, not knowing that what I was really buying was a pretzel rod....live and learn...<br /><br />Anyway, once I realized that I had bought these ""mini-rods"" I could get on with the taste testing. Testing good. Up to the Newman standards...and there is this completely illogical belief that having the exact same calories spread over three or four pieces instead of one large pretzel is more satisfying...bonus..."	0	0

-1	B004IREFUM	A2S4DN72TMWC2C	Meh	"This review pertains to the Black Silk only. If you are thinking of skimping on your next K-Cup purchase, read this.<br /><br />No surprise, but you get what you pay for. While many of the other brands of K-Cups say ""100% Arabica Coffee"" on the side of the package, these merely say, ""100% Coffee"" - so you know there's gotta be some Robusta in there somewhere. I'd say the flavor is OK if you enjoy the free coffee at your local car dealership while waiting for a repair. Maybe even a step up to ""diner coffee."" Not terrible, but definitely leaves a burned aftertaste in your mouth. These were OK to try, but I would spend the extra pennies for better quality K-Cups in the future."	0	0

1	B004RGV70U	A3I9K8CVBH81GX	If you don't like sour, don't try it!	I read some reviews on other warheads, but obviously they didn't realize what they are. If you like sour, buy these! They are amazing, don't eat 10 in a row because it will ruin your taste buds, but they are good if you don't go too crazy. I would recommend them to any and everyone, as long as you can handle it!	3	0
1	B000FD78O8	A11NPK6BX0VWP9	Can vs Frozen	"When I bought Reese Artichoke Hearts, it was less than $25/case and I didn't want to pay for shipping so I had one of my friend bought one for herself with me. It worked out great, the shipping was speedy and ate them fairly quickly since the experation date was quite close. However, It didn't bother me that much since I paid so much less than I normally pay for them at a grocery store.<br /><br />But one thing that I realized was these canned Artichoke isn't as good as Frozen ones.<br />I didn't really notice it until I heard many chefs on TV would say things like ""use the fresh artichoke if you could, but if it's not available, use frozen one or those ones in a jar. Not the canned ones."" So after I finished with my 12 cans, I started to use the frozen artichoke and I think it actully taste better. Frozen ones don't have that sourness in them. Or maybe it is just me....or just those celebrity chefs on TV...."	0	0

1	B001EQ55ZO	A3A1OA237FOZFK	Interesting flavor, Strangely addictive	I love cashews but wasn't so sure how I was going to like them with pepper added.  At first, I thought they were just okay.  I ate a few and then put them away.  A short while later, I found myself wanting a few more and this seemed to just keep happening.  The pepper makes for an interesting flavor, and when combined with the sea salt - well, they became strangely addictive.  I recommend anyone who likes cashews to give them a try!  The only reason I gave them 4 stars, though, was that some of the cashews were overwhelmed with salt.	0	1
-1	B000GBYR9I	ALMWXWBEFCBOB	overpriced due to markup	More than doubling the retail price is hoggish.  I wish Amazon exercised at least some control over resellers like this who hugely mark up products that can be bought elsewhere on the web, such as from the manufacturer.  I recommend you shop around, both to save more than 50% of the price and in order not to support resellers like this.  By the way, a similar review to this one was just removed from the website.  I guess the reseller doesn't want it to be known how much they mark this product up...	2	1

Therefore I'm able to offer a blended review.<br /><br />This drink is very, very sweet.  The carbonation gives it a soda effect, which seems to be very important to a young teen; for me, on the other hand, it really didn't have any impact on improving my opinion.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer stated, this drink taste a lot like a jolly rancher.  I must agree with that statement.<br /><br />So, if you prefer a candy flavor drink, this drink is for you.  Otherwise, it's not.	0	0

Other flavor tried was orange which did nothing for me.  If you use cytomax you will not need to wash down those clumpy gels.  Try mixing two bottles and freezing one of them.  It is a tasty treat about one hour into a long bike ride.	1	0
1	B006HYLW32	A41MKHZQ85J9U	Delicious	I really liked these.  Great snack for someone watching their fat and or calorie intake.  Light, crunchy and full of flavor.  They don't taste like a traditional chip they seem infused with air or something.  The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues.	1	0
1	B0001KCICW	A13OTJ4746R6AF	So delicious it will make you smile and count your blessings!

Treat yourself to this gorgeous, deep ruby preserve and let the delight soak through you!

-1	B001RIXU9M	A2DNOLR6ISQDHO	If you like your cashews oily, you may love these -.	"I have purchased a lot of cashews from Amazon but this was my first experience with this brand. I was very happy with the nuts I had been getting and I tried this one for just two reasons: [1] The brands I usually order were out of stock and [2] among the the reasonably priced cashews, this one had the best reviews. I note that one review did say they were very oily but, in the end, that reviewer gave the product a 5 star rating. Well, that reviewer was certainly correct about one thing: these nuts are very oily. The walls of the package were so oil coated that I could barely see the nuts inside. My immediate reaction was to contact Amazon for a return label. But the site said food products were not returnable. I decided to call because I thought that there was significant misrepresentation of the product and that they would make an exception for that. Then I discovered that Amazon no longer takes phone calls to Customer Service!!! While I am surprised and a bit unhappy that Amazon has cut off calls to Customer Service, their ""no return policy"" on foods bothers me even more because the result is that anyone who calls their product a food gets a free pass on the requirement for an accurate description of the item. In the case of these cashews, the picture in the product description shows the nuts inside the container very  clearly, whereas they are barely visible through the  oil film on the inside of the package.<br />  Well, I decided to try to make the best of it, so I emptied the nuts onto paper towels, as the reviewer mentioned above had done. and dried them off as well as I could. Unfortunately, the remaining oil had an old taste that was definitely not pleasant.<br />  I have rated this product at 2 stars just because I have not tried all the cashew brands at Amazon and there may well be some that are still worse.<br />  In fairness to Emerald Harmony, these are the only oil roasted cashews I have purchased.[Oil is not mentioned by them and most other brands are dry roasted]<br />  And in fairness to Amazon, I want to say that this is the only product I have purchased from them where i have been unhappy with the final outcome."	2	0
1	B000F0JOVG	A2Y8IDC1FKGNJC	DeBoles Spaghetti	DeBoles Spaghetti turns out perfectly, pot after pot. The trick is bringing the water (with a little olive oil in it) to a rolling boil, before adding the pasta. Then boil for ten minutes, remove immediately, and drain. The pasta is al dente and never sticky, hard, or mushy. I will continue to buy this pasta. It is much better than NRG and other brands.	0	0

-1	B004MO6NI8	A3PECZX773ME74	Fear	"No Fear,Super Energy Supplement, 16-Ounce Cans<br /><br />No fear energy drink was tasty and it did have caffeine that gave it a kick to keep you going through the day. It had a high sugar content of 20 MGs. I think that's a little high which made it a little too sweet for my taste. However I know there are people out there that truly like sugar and prefer it in their coffee and tea. Not me! I like something more tart. I truly prefer coffee for a jump start and some of the other drinks to get an actual juice flavor. ""No fear"" had a fruity taste to it which was probably wears some of the vitamin B content came from. The price seemed a little high so for me I would have to give it three stars and nothing more. I could only drink this in a pinch.<br /><br />If you're going to try this drink then my recommendation would be to use it very judiciously and take the cost factor into account when you're drinking it."	0	0

-1	B000SDKDM4	A30EZF8N9XHXJ6	HORRIBLE COFFEE: DO NOT BUY!	This espresso was a disappointment from the start: unpleasant aroma, coffee beans not oily at all. Smelled like the beans were old.<br />Anyhow, I made espresso with it and tasted it. Like how it looked, the taste wasn't good either. This coffee is more on the acidic side. It sort of smelled and tasted like instant coffee. I use Rancilio Silvia espresso machine and Rocky grinder so I cannot blame the machine for a bad espresso coffee. Do not buy this espresso beans if you are espresso drinker because you will know right away that you wasted money on a crappy coffee. If you have not found good espresso coffee beans, I suggest going to local Peet's Coffee shop(if available), and ask for Espresso Forte. Because the company roasts coffee beans every day, they have very nice aroma and taste awesome too.	1	4
1	B000HDK0D2	A2E9R6URH4XQZ8	Delicious!	I bought these lollipops for my allergic kids, because these are the only lollipops I have found that don't contain corn.

-1	B001EO5YDY	A3QIJ21RO4QZN4	A matter of taste	Folks in the office, including yours truly, found these to be cloying and artificial tasting. Regardless of which flavor you select, they all have the same underlying maple flavor. Some people love flavored coffees, and maybe, with a lot of sugar, these would float your boat. True coffee afficionados will pass on these.	3	2
-1	B000O7Z71G	A204WOS4OMHO5X	SPLENDA Alert	I was VERY disappointed in the Chai Tea Latte.  I was very excited to try it and after brewing my first cup the smell was of a wonderful creamy pumpkin pie.  But after my first sip I knew there was something horribly wrong.  Sure enough I realized I should have looked at the ingredients before spending $9.  The chai tea disk contains Splenda (sucralose) which to those of us who can't stand the stuff, and can detect it in any food no matter how subtle the metallic aftertaste, was a HUGE disappointment.  It makes no sense to me why the makers would use Splenda to sweeten the chai tea when the latte creamer includes sugar already.  So if you like or don't mind Splenda you will probably really enjoy this.  On the other hand if you are sensitive to it your first cup may also be your last, as mine was.  :(	54	13

1	B0004LXAKM	A2E8X9QNTWSDZZ	Better than the other guy says...and why.	I think this is pretty good pop. I wouldn't try to compare a mix with plain water to a well-prepared fresh pink lemonade, but this stuff is OK. Unfortunately, if you dilute it too much it gets bitter and acidic. The excess water causes extra ionization of the citric acid and lowers the Ph considerably. Make it with, at most, 48oz of spring water per package and you'll love it. Except if you want homemade lemonade...	0	0
-1	B001KPO1T0	A4D9AIUP1NNIY	Quality? Maybe. Taste? Not so good	I have tried some pu erh tea that I enjoyed for the unique taste, however this matcha is either bad quality or I would just not recommend this item. I have had red tea matcha and green tea matcha and this does not even come close in taste or the texture whisked in. I would reccomend not getting this type of matcha at all, that's not to say I don't like this tea, I love it, that's why I ordered the medium size one. If I had to rate this tea from one to ten, this would be in the three to four range.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical forking out so much money for this type of tea since I was well aware of the quality it could be and as well as 'fake' or lower grades being sold for good quality matcha. I downright would prefer the lose leaf tea over this.	0	0
1	B000UZLQG2	ADF99TUO6VUIG	Closest thing to theater popcorn I have come across so far.	After a long bit of research we finally decided on this product to try and produce theater liek popcorn. This product by far has come the closest yet. We poured a little into a squeeze bottle and then while the popcorn is popping, put the bottle in hot water. By the time the popcorn is done, the butter flavor stuff is warm and very tastey. We squirt a little on the popcorn, add some special popcorn, flavored salt and voila, theater popcorn.  It's great.	1	0

Cereal has always been kind of a pain for me because I usually like to sleep in and it's not something I can take to work with me.  These have been great.  I can grab one on the way to work or throw one in my lunchbox.  They are a super convenient way to get my fiber.<br /><br />The added bonus is that they taste pretty good and satisfy my sweet tooth while being pretty low and fat and decent in calories.<br /><br />I'd recommend them to anyone that wants a better way to get more fiber.	0	0
-1	B002QTWTN4	AUZ6HVEXN5LP1	Too skimpy with the cheese	In going for a healthier item, Annie's seems to have cut down on the cheese to the point where it's just enough to barely coat the macaroni. It's not at all like traditional mac'n'cheese that has a lush, rich, thick coating of cheese; the cheese entirely disappears into the pasta.<br /><br />If healthiness is your main goal, maybe this is an acceptable version. If you want a traditional taste, this will not do it.	0	0

I still like them, as long as I eat them with a dip of some type...hummus, bean dip, etc., vs. just alone. I did purchase them again, thinking they might be better, but so far, again they are pretty bland. They're a healthy snack, but I probably won't order them again."	2	0

1	B0042GWKZQ	A1F2LU6ROV0TEA	SIMPLY THE BEST--BETTER THAN ALL THE REST!!!	I'm one of the fortunate who for many yrs have lived near the So. San Fran See's factory 'n store and enjoyed that pure goodness that is uniquely See's.  It really is the best!  Unfortunately, my first order thru Amazon arrived damaged and not that mega freshness that I know so well.  At no cost to me, a replacement order was sent immediately and w/ no requirement to return the damaged order.  Replacement order was indeed, that pure 'lit'l slice of heaven on earth' that all See's lovers know so well -- quality, goodness, customer service extraordinaire and total class act the See's way!	1	0
1	B001LXYA5Q	AUYFLO4G86J1W	So much fun - but don't forget the Tums!	My friend and I had a flavor tripping party for two.  We each dissolved one tablet on our tongues and then dug in to a plate full of lemons, limes and other sour items.  The effect was immediate and amazing.  We were laughing hysterically throughout the whole ordeal.  We also tried shots of vinegar, mustard by the spoonful (really yummy) and several other types of fruit.  We had a blast finding new things to try.  I think next we're going to have a big group over to play around.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you can split the tablets in half to lessen the effect.  Remember - if you're going to have a flavor tripping party of your own, pack some antacid.  After all we ate, we really needed it.<br /><br />Updates 12/20 - I gave mberry pills to friends for the holidays.  The pills didn't work for all of them.  Judging by some of the reviews the pills either don't work for everyone or not every pill is the same potency.  I contacted the seller who put me in touch with the manufacturer and they are sending me out a replacement batch to give the people who had a bad experience.  Excellent customer service all around.  I still wholeheartedly recommend giving the tablets a try.  If it works for you, it is really amazing.	4	0
-1	B000V1D19A	A15FJIW9680JF6	Way too salty!	I've enjoyed their Butter Chicken many times and thought that I'd give the curry a try.  Big mistake.  Following the recipe yields a dish that borders on inedible, it is that salty.  I was really hoping that this curry pack could be a staple item in my pantry.  Alas, no.  Unless you enjoy your food Dead Sea salty, avoid this product.	0	2

1	B001KUSLGY	A18Q69FAZ3AP38	After the second can, you'll never go back!	"I cannot say enough good things about this soda.  It is expensive, but worth every penny.  I tried to lose weight by drinking diet soda made with those horrible chemical sweeteners like Nutrasweet.  They left me dry-mouthed and cranky, and hungrier than when I started!<br /><br />Zevia is sweetened with Stevia, an all-natural sweetener.  Drink two cans and you'll never go back. I say drink two cans because Stevia does taste a little different, and it is intensely sweet like the high-fructose corn syrup sodas are.  After the second can, you'll be used to the taste and you'll also be amazed how much better you feel.<br /><br />This soda actually curbs my appetite.  My system doesn't rebel against it, like it does with those ""frankensweetener"" diet sodas.  I also don't feel bloated and sugar-crashy, like I do when I drink the corn-syrup sodas.  I suspect the non-chemical sweetness of this drink tricks my body into thinking that I drank a regular soda. Zevia finally enabled me to stop drinking regular soda entirely!<br /><br />You've gotta try this stuff!"	2	0

1	B007TJGY5K	A2VMT89TCSF105	Jazz up the decaf	The first time I heard about decaf (on a sitcom), I assumed it was a joke. Yet, those bottled laughs weren't heard in the background. Could it be...? An American teacher later informed me that yes, there really is such a thing.<br /><br />Decaf must be the most stupid invention in world history. I mean, coffee without caffeine?! That's rather like coke without cocaine. Or tobacco without nicotine. Or the Democratic Party without Bill Clinton.<br /><br />It lacks the active substance.	1	6
1	B000GZYAN2	A1VRAW0P0ZZ7BK	Delish!	I made a single serving in the microwave last night using a generic, low calorie, low carb vanilla yogurt. I was pleasantly surprised! It was so yummy. Very chocolatey. I had to add more than 1 tbsp of the yogurt, but only a tad. I have not baked a whole batch yet, as it is only me in the house, so I cannot comment on how they turn out in the oven, but the single servings are great.	0	0
1	B000UPALJ0	AFLUI0X7OK0CZ	Best diet drink and NO artificial sweetners!	I bought the Strawberry Kiwi power mix.  It seemed expensive until I realized that I only need half for my water bottle.  It is refreshing, has a great taste and best of all -- no Equal or Splenda or other fake chemical sugar -- which all give me headaches.<br /><br />I was drinking bottled water all day any way and now it also helps me curb my hunger cravings til my next meal.  I am going to buy the other flavors.  It is also easy to carry with you so you can add to water you get at restaurant -- saves on the cost of the meal by eliminating the drink cost!<br /><br />LOVE IT *** LOVE IT !!!	2	0
1	B000MRTSB8	A1Z54EM24Y40LL	Same great taste!	Golly, writing this review is making me drool!  Years ago, you could only buy these in Ohio at Christmastime.  However, some wise soul figured it would make good marketing sense to make them available year round for us addicts and well, voila! No more buying tons of these boxes at Christmas and storing them in the freezer all year!  Golly these things are awesome!  I've been eating them for 40 years and still can't get enough of them. In my husband's family, they were always the first gift of Christmas, delivered from Santa.  These things are in so many family traditions, that they HAVE to be doing something right. The only difference I notice is that the cherries are smaller than they were 20 years ago.  Other than that, they haven't mucked with the taste, the cordial filling, or anything else!  Highly, highly recommend!	0	0

1	B000PDY3P0	AHA4F2MXWRC42	Just like the movies	"For the longest time, I made microwave popcorn. Never again. When I first ventured into popping my own, I bought a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R"">West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a>. I then went to the store and bought some popcorn oil and some kernels. I was so disappointed when I had it.<br /><br />Then a friend recommended this popcorn to me, and I absolutely love it. I've bought two boxes so far from Amazon. It tastes as close to anything I've ever had to movie popcorn (minus the butter).<br /><br />A few suggestions if you use this with the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />- If you use a Stir Crazy, the 4 oz. packs will fill it up perfectly.<br />- Separate kernels on both sides of the rod in the middle, and distribute the oil in 2 portions on either side also.<br />- Enjoy!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />+ All ingredients in 1 pack.<br /><br />+ Tastes incredible.<br /><br />+ You can use as much or as little butter salt as you want.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Coconut oil is a bit sticky when you squeeze it out of the pack.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended."	1	0

1	B0081XIASW	A2T6RF0A6KEIDL	Entertaining Toy	Skyy likes this toy. It took her a while to figure out who to move the spinner toy, but once she got it, there was no stopping her. It's not as exciting for as her Smart Toys IQ Treat Ball, but she still gets excited when she sees me filling it. She runs to the rug where, I usually put it, and she has fun pushing it to get her treasures out. A great entertaining, and stimulating, toy for any dog! Highly recommend!	0	0
-1	B000CMFMFE	A1SVILVED8LL2C	Decent	"Soy nuts are never going to be anyone's idea of comfort food.  No one's ever going to come home at the end of a hard day and say, ""Man, I could go for a beer and some soy nuts!""  If you're eating these, it's probably because you're trying to find something to take the place of a much-less-healthy snack that you'd otherwise be eating.<br /><br />All that being said, these aren't half bad.  They are, as another reviewer noted, somewhat chalky.  You will want to have something to drink with these -- preferably water.  The flavor of these is pretty good, though.  Barbecue is the best of the various flavors these come in.  One problem with the soy nuts is that the manufacturer hasn't seemed to figure out how to get the flavoring powder to stick well to the soy nuts.  Because of this, a lot of the powder falls off, and the flavor has to be reasonably strong for you to taste it.  Barbecue makes it pretty well, whereas some of the other available flavors don't.<br /><br />Once again, these aren't bad.  I don't know if I'll buy them again, though.  I MUCH prefer Genisoy's soy crisps, which are genuinely awesome, and almost as healthy."	4	0

-1	B004SRH2B6	A1G9EZSK3QC0UI	from concentrate! tastes horrible! yuck!	"I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket. I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package...Boy was I wrong!<br />I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth, it also left the other way! Yuck! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts. I then looked at the ingredients and see ""premium coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors.""<br />I just don't get it: Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle--and charge more for it!? Am I missing something?<br />The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation. There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco, one, on the market, so why settle for something from concentrate, pay more for it, and hurt the planet with more plastic?"	31	10

-1	B000PDY3P0	AU9NEN7VK9SK3	good taste, solidified oil	I was concerned when I received it because of the oil being solidified.  I looked for a date on it to see if it was old product, but did not find any dates.  I tried one package to see how it tasted.  It tasted normal.  It was a little more difficult to get out of the package since I had to do just the oil first to let it melt before putting the popcorn and seasoning parts of the package in.  It would be nice if the packages were dated so that I know how long I have to use them for best results, and I'm really not sure of how old they are to begin with.<br /><br />So bottom line, I was happy with the taste, but convenience is somewhat diminished because the oil is solid.<br /><br />Added 11/28/11 - I do prefer to use less of the seasoned salt.  It's pretty salty for me, so I just don't use it all and it tastes fine still.	0	5

1	B00176MMZM	A31D7MPI6G4E9I	Love the taste!	There's a cafe in Midtown NY I go to that uses this brand of Chai mix. Really happy that I was able to go this as it'll save me money in the long run!<br /><br />In terms of taste, I really like the fact that this kind of Chai has more flavor - due to it being 'spiced'. As well, I recommend using whole milk with it as it'll give the chai more of a body. Water works just as well, but the taste underneath is slightly different. If you're one to not care much about that then just use what you like. (As an aside, I like the taste of this more than the Starbucks Chai latte if you need a comparison.)	0	0

1	B001EO7HE8	A268LOQQCRTGUH	Excellent sauce, milder than the green lid	I was excited to see a new line of Sriracha sauce in my grocery store so I scooped this up the first day I saw it.<br /><br />This sauce is packed with flavor, it is tangy and showcases the flavors of the chili and garlic right out front. It is not as hot as the Huy Fong Sriracha sauce in the green lid and also has a tangier flavor.	7	2

1	B000WB1YSE	A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO	The Real Deal	I've tried many different green teas in the States & abroad.  When I lived in Philadelphia, I had many Japanese friends there who made terrific green tea--but until now I couldn't find one to rival theirs.  This one does.  It's tasty & flavorful, certainly not bitter--even if you steep it overlong.  The bags are interesting too.  My only problem is that the string is attached to the middle of each bag vs. the end--which can be annoying--easier for it to slip into the cup while brewing (esp. if you're using a microwave to heat it) & also if you use a squeezing device to get the brewed tea out of the bag itself before disposing of it.  Still, this minor inconvenience hardly affects the value of this tasteful product.  I'm about to purchase some more.	8	0

1	B001FCFYU8	A276CFPBYBLQNT	Excellent flavor...the best I have tried	"Since I drink between eight and ten cups of green tea a day, I am very fussy about the taste.  It must be pure green tea, I don't care for added flavors.  I LOVE this tea. Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, ""that is why it is called green tea!"""	7	1
-1	B000084E6V	A1LE76IRVZNY7C	Updated: Durable So Far--Not Really	I ordered this for my 15-lb Jack Russell. We got the stegosaurus toy and so far, it's held up. She's a ferocious chewer--we can't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits. The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body, and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once, meaning she can't play with this unless we're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it. It would've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering. I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured, which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail. The good news is, steggie doesn't have a small projectile head or tail, but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail, so no worries about small pieces coming off there. The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars, but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs, tail, head, and half the body. I don't mind if she ingests tiny shreds of a Nylabone on occasion, but I can't imagine eating 4 ounces of plastic is doing anyone's digestive tract any favors.	0	0

Tasted, looked, and felt like the real thing (and I'm very picky with taste...I hate whole-wheat pasta because it's different than regular pasta).

1	B003ZI7CYQ	ALM1IZ1PNBCF5	Best dark chocolate anywhere.	"We had been buying this same dark chocolate under the label ""H&auml;geland"" for a few years now.  Under that name, it was limited to a well-known big box store.  They stopped carrying the product recently, which I don't understand because this chocolate is sooo good.  When my mother-in-law called the number on the H&auml;geland label to ask where we might buy it, she was told to check Amazon under this name.<br /><br />I am far from a chocolate connoisseur, so I can't use fancy words to describe color, aroma, texture, or flavor.  I just know tasty and not tasty.  This one is quite tasty.  The thing that set this chocolate apart for us was the lack of soy lecithin which is used as an emulsifier in most other chocolate bars.  To me, the soy lecithin gives other chocolates a bit of a waxy consistency.  (Don't get me wrong, if it's chocolate, I'll eat it happily. However, this one is our favorite.)  If you're looking for simple, reliably delicious, dark-but-not-too-bitter chocolate bar, please give this one a try.  I'd love to see them do well on Amazon."	4	0

If you have been following prop 37 in cal you will know that kraft is fighting your right to know if gmos are in your food.<br /><br />I was tricked by the lack of the name kraft on the box and bought a box last night.<br /><br />It's time we take a stand to these big corporations who are poisoning us and stop buying their products!!!	1	0

1	B002TP7QQU	A32DCJHKUG1KAL	Really good, but not enough bunches	This is probably one of my favorites of all the honey bunches of oats cereals. Unfortunately, there aren't very many bunches, which are the things that make this taste really good. Nonetheless, it's still a great cereal and I will continue to buy it once in a while.	0	0
1	B00374W630	A25UZ7MA72SMKM	Enjoyable	When it comes to refried beans, I don't know if there is a lot of difference. These certainly taste similar to the ones we get at our favorite Mexican restaurant. They have a good consistency, and are enjoyable hot or cold.<br /><br />The interesting thing about the fat free version is that a serving is exactly the same calories as the regular version. There is just a little fat in the regular version. I can't really discern a difference in taste between the two, and the small amount of fat in the regular version hardly seems of consequence.<br /><br />Either way, a serving is less than 100 calories and has an acceptable amount of protein.	2	0

1	B0054I4LTO	A2EXGRAA6QW96Z	Sweet Content	"Sarah Delany said, ""Life is short, and it is up to you to make it sweet.""<br /><br />You can make it sweet without the calories by using ""Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener"" 0 Calories, 0 Fat, 0 mg Sodium, 2g Total Carbs and 0g Protein. This product also packs 1 gram of fiber into each packet.<br /><br />The nice thing about Splenda is that you can use it in recipes that require high heat -- sucralose is heat stable up to 450F (232 C).<br /><br />I did this, using Splenda to replace one third of the sugar in a lemon bar recipe. This recipe -- Shortbread Lemon Bars (just google it -- it's near the top of the search results) -- called for nearly three cups of sugar counting the crust, filling and topping; too much for someone who is watching her sugar and carbohydrate intake. The lemon bars baked up beautifully and tasted scrumptious.<br /><br />My husband, who hates the taste of artificial sweeteners, liked these lemon bars and said he could barely perceive any artificial taste.<br /><br />I used this Splenda Sweetener in homemade lemonade by the glass, adding one packet to 2.5 cups of water and the juice of a small lemon. This was super. I also used a packet in a cup of hot tea with splendid results.<br /><br />The box states that it has 80 packets within. My box had 82 packets. I used 80 in the lemon bars, 1 in the lemonade and 1 in the tea. If you prefer a less labor-intensive afternoon than I had, standing at the counter opening 80 packets, Splenda is also available in a 1.2-pound bag."	0	0
-1	B003VXHGE6	A2V7T3C2T2RVPH	Just OK	"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead."	0	0
-1	B005CUU23S	AIX91OJ0O3BV2	A so-so reaction from our dog	I guess the idea here is that you can reward your dog with quick and tasty lick of a thin liquid on a roller ball. Seems like a decent idea, especially if you're trying to train your dog.<br /><br />The problem, in our case anyway, is that our dog is sort of lukewarm on this treat. He'll lick it sometimes, but other times, he just isn't interested. I asked him why, but he declined to comment.	0	0

1	B005EF0HTK	A3UKWQS8SRW6IO	Good variety	This gift basket had a good variety of sweets (truffles, cookies, nuts and fruit mixture, napolitans, chocolate covered raisins, caramels) as well as some savory (cheese spread, crackers, peanuts, almonds), plus a few things that got eaten before I had a chance to note them for this review.  Other than the Sunmaid chocolate covered raisins I was not familiar with the brand names. For example, the most of the sweets were made by Kenzi, of whom I had never heard. Their quality was O.K., but not outstanding (but then again I am very picky  - my son thought it was just fine, but he was probably full from eating the pilfered items). The quantities of each product were the small sizes common to gift baskets. All in all, this is not a basket that will wow a chocolate connoisseur and, again typical of gift baskets, is not a great deal, but it would definately make an appreciated hostess or other gift.	4	1

1	B001EO5ZGU	A33JE9EEYUM3R8	A GREAT NATURAL PRODUCT	Sugar In The Raw has been around for over twenty years and is still a great product.  Refining sugar has never made sense to me, as food is best when minimally processed.  Unlike brown sugar, which is made of white sugar and molasses recombined, raw sugars are not separated and recombined.  Sugar In The Raw, unlike brown sugar is not sticky and easy to measure.  Less processing of foods preserves more of a foods vitamins and minerals in their original form.  Sugar In The Raw makes fine tapioca and pumpkin pudding and requires no additional time.  tapioca made with raw sugar is slightly darker looking and richer tasting.  Makes good hot chocolate when mixed with powered baker's chocolate and milk.	2	1

I prefer to mix it into shakes for a nut flavor instead of making a PB&J sandwhich out of it. But even w/ a sandwhich, it's not that bad, because w/ the real thing I eat too much.

Good for natural disasters, power outages, camping, college dorms, financial shortages or times when you just don't feel like cooking anything.<br /><br />One pack is the perfect serving size for a sandwich or to chop up and mix with a can of beans for a filling meal.<br /><br />You can also eat it straight from the package without barfing because it doesn't have a ring of gelatinous goo like its canned counterpart."	7	1

The Malabar Triple X blend was OK. The El Salvador Dali blend is delicious. Smooth a little smoky and a little darker than the Mexican decaf. (the Mexican decaf looks like ground cinnamon) This would be a good one to start with if you haven't tried Larry's before.	0	0
1	B0012KH0F0	AALWYV9IY0EKZ	Party mix is now one of my cat's favorite treats	"The various Friskies ""party mix"" flavors of treats really appeal to my cat's taste buds. They are his new favorites. Especially the Beachside Crunch version. He used to be a treat fanatic, but lately he hasn't been eating as many treats because he's been filling up more on wet food; that's sort of replaced his ""dry treat"" routine. However, he usually will still eat the party mix if I give it to him, even if he shuns other treats.<br /><br />And one other great thing about party mix - the price is cheap, but you get a lot for your money, since it is a good-sized bag. Great taste, great value - what's not to like?"	0	0

I don't know what ""spice"" they used but it's drowns out the pumpkin taste (kind of like ""allspice"" does).  I like my coffee with just a little milk and many people are recommending this with a flavored creamer so that may help.  I like it enough to finish the box but probably won't buy it again.  I make my OWN pumpkin spice lattes (VERY EASY- look online for recipe) and will stick to that in the future."	0	0
1	B000CB54S0	A29LDSBND2TBCC	Bubble Tea Kit	This is a fun and unique gift pack.  Great for teens and young folks (who don't need supervision in the kitchen).  Instructions were straight forward and the end result turned out great!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />First step involved boiling the tapioca pearls.  Just make sure you have enough (if not additional water in the pot).  Because of the excess starches, these pearls need room to expand and soak.  Don't over cook.<br /><br />After drained and cooled, you make (shake) the packet ingredients.  Our favorite was strawberry, but Mango came in a close second.  Have not tried the tarrot yet (fear of the unknown).<br /><br />We even tried standard lemonade (our own making) with the bubble pearls and it was good as well.<br /><br />Don't forget to get extra straws.  You can't suck these pearls through standard sippy straws.<br /><br />Happy bubbling.	1	0
1	B004BKLHOS	A55PK06Q6AKFY	good basic graham cracker	These graham crackers are quite good; they are made from wholesome ingredients, and they taste delicious.  They are very thin, almost wafer-like crackers made from whole wheat flour, rolled oats, and natural sweeteners, including honey.  They are relatively low-calorie, with 110 calories per serving, and they are a very good source of whole grains.  If you're not going to buy organic, this is a reasonable alternative, with natural ingredients and produced by a brand that uses recycled packaging and contributes money to the Nature Conservancy (although it is owned by Kraft).  I would have given them a 5 out of 5, but I've had the apple cinnamon graham crackers that Back To Nature also makes, and those are much, much better tasting.  I you are not a fan of apple cinnamon or are looking for the traditional honey graham cracker, definitely buy these.  Otherwise, I would have to recommend the apple cinnamon flavor over these.	0	0

They are also kept in the breakroom and since they do not have to be refrigerated they make for a very nice option for our clients.  Great value too since we can purchase such a large number of cups at one time.  Very handy on the road too.

So now we have to get the 37oz size to keep from going to the store every week. I have yet to meet a dog that didn't go nuts for this snack.

1	B001J9URUY	A7WEPZL9UYZML	My NON-Chewer loves this!	We have a 3 year old German Shepherd / Australian Shepherd mix and we had yet to find a chew toy that she would use at all.  She has some separation anxiety, so I was hoping that this would be something we could toss into her crate for her to enjoy for a couple of hours if we left the house.<br /><br />I ordered this 3 days ago & got it today!  When I gave it to Pixie, she paced around the house with it in her mouth for a few minutes - I don't think she really even knew what to do with it!  Finally, she flopped down onto the floor and held it between her paws and went to town.  She chewed HARD for about an hour and it still looks almost brand new.  When she went to get a drink, I grabbed it and put it away for another time.<br /><br />Then I logged into to Amazon & ordered the XL size.  I'm thrilled!	0	0
1	B001TM70V0	AUW5XC67E9MIL	Green Eggs & Chicken, 3 Paws Up (includes a 17 yo and 7 yo picky Debutantes). Great Human Grade Cat Food Experience	"During the cat food recalls of 2007, I became aware that the dry food I always fed my cats was not a good diet. In fact - at the time - I prided myself on feeding cats @ $8.00 a month.  Luckily, this Generic was not using the Gluten that was the cause of the Recalls.  After trying various tastes, my budget and cats decided on Holistic (use to be Eagle Pack Holistic) Chicken dry and Wellness Chicken Grain Free.<br /><br />Then, we had a problem with the Wellness Canned Cat Food Recently (it was pulled from Amazon - and now my Canned Chicken food doesn't show up in a review).  I then went to the Wellpet site, and noticed mostly dry food was offered from many online retailers.  THIS told me something was afoot - and I went back to the forum which helped me with cat food research.  Unfortunately, many folks had gone back to fish as a main part of their cats food.  However, they did bring up the rotation aspect - this means never feeding the same type of cat food concurrently, and also picking up some locally first, to make sure your cats will eat the darn thing.<br /><br />Locally, Chicken was the least affected of the Wellness foods, and the store I get it from, Wellness is manufactured at ANI (code begins MW).  This means I could also get a food that was produced at Menu/Simmons.  However, Weruva was raved about in the forums, so without knowing where it was manufactured - I gave a few cans a shot (Green Eggs & Chicken was the first flavor I read - so that is what I tried).  All cats slopped that food right up with no ill effects (Siberia is a 13 yo with sensi tummy issues, and there were none with this food - even after he gulped it up).<br /><br />I then looked up Weruva on the Internet, and found out it was manufactured in Thailand.  This first gave me pause, but they do guarantee Human Grade Food, and the food in the cans look quite edible (and no, I'm not eating it - but in an emergency ;-).<br /><br />Amazon has a better deal on this food than my local retailer. So my order for the cans went in (I had read some negative reviews here about the quality of the food, but with the Amazon Guarantee - how can you go wrong?)  I am pleased to announce that the food received from Amazon looked and tasted (according to the cats), as good as that purchased locally.  So for Weruva, Amazon has my business.<br /><br />With rotation, you can circumvent the cost of Weruva in a multi-cat household, AND being on a fixed income, through rotating.  I've settled on four canned food varieties, and one dry food (I may also be inclined to try some Weruva Paw Licken' Chicken, but for now - I have plenty of food).  The cost for multi-cat households is also offset by buying the larger canned varieties - 12.5oz to 13oz, and learning how to store them in the Refrigerator.<br /><br />On Amazon, I recommend the following:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY"">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM"">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248"">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (I had used it in 2007, and decided it wouldn't hurt them in a rotation.  Its the only wet food that contains some fish).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0"">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn't hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />A side note, many supplement with Friskies canned in order to cut costs.  I personally have yet to get over the meat by-product thing.  However, if it would help your budget - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6"">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> is THE best one to use for this purpose (no glutens).<br /><br />3 paws up for Weruva."	4	0
1	B0088LNRK8	A3EA9NG1P36HMI	Delicious Rub!	I love grilling fish, chicken, beef and veggies (for my vegetarian family members) and this stuff is just amazing! I will definitely keep this in stock in my kitchen pantry. Subtle flavors, definitely restaurant quality.	0	0
1	B000LKVJCC	A3GNMIWI67C2ZU	Great for packing school lunch	Pros:<br /><br />1.  Great for packing lunch as an alternative to water and juice.  No refrigeration required.<br />2.  About $1 per carton, relatively cheap giving the convenience it provides.<br />3.  Tastes better than the Horizon brand for organic milk.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1.  About six months expiration.  Will have to rotate stock if stocking up for emergency.<br />2.  Too convenient for the kids.  Kids go for it instead of the gallons even when at home.	0	0

-1	B000CQG8KS	A1SCANWWQTEG9I	Too oily	I enjoy many types of tea, the more flavorful the better. I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good. It has a very oily taste to it. I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again.	1	4

1	B003OP5526	A2TKKLZTJV4NLV	Not quite strong enough, but very good	This is a very good coffee blend, but it is not quite as strong as I like. I find myself having to use more coffee to make it taste strong enough. For the average person, this would be fine. I prefer a stronger blend, like Suzi's, which is my favorite.	0	0
-1	B003LPMC3O	A3LGIQTY31TPDE	Natural Alternative--But Too Sweet	I was excited to see a natural alternative to soda, and carbonated no less!

-1	B002G06NEO	AMQRCLDBYOMHT	Misleading use of artificial sweeteners	"I have used stevia for a few years without ill effects. I was surprised when trying this product recently that I started to get this extremely restless sort of insomnia a few days after I started drinking this product daily. I have had this symptom before from other diet sodas, but I was surprised that Zevia, presumably just stevia, would also cause this.<br />Finally I scrutinized the ingredients and discovered Erythritol, a sweetener with a less than a good reputation. Another neurotoxin to add to my do not consume list.<br />My annoyance with Zevia is the way the packaging touts the stevia, and fails to mention the use of another artificial sweetener. I do read ingredient lists but didn't recognize the chemical name, thinking it may have been a colorant. I am not a chemist obviously, and the manufacturer's marketing of this product borders on deception.<br />It is also interesting to note that this is the same combo of chemicals used by Truvia, again with the emphasis on the more natural compound (Reb A derived from plant stevia). I am suspicious of the fact that ""official"" sites for these resultant products, and many medical sites, won't discuss some of the symptoms that many people are reporting through less official channels. However, almost every site specifically about insomnia that interacts with the public does list all the artificial sweeteners as a likely hidden cause of insomnia. There are other adverse side effects as well, and I wouldn't presume to know which are more common. I hope someone is studying this. The manufacturers appear to be content in ignoring these symptoms, as long as a significant number of folks don't experience it in there short term trials. We need a stronger FDA, undoubtedly.<br />Buyer Beware!<br />(btw, liquid stevia extracts that are available in different flavors, are really delicious in sparkling waters.)"	6	7
1	B003ZXCC5K	A1TMVPN6TU24ML	Tastes yummy, can get it elsewhere for less $	This shake tastes great. It is sweet and tastes like creamy vanilla pudding.  It fills you up for a long time, just like its supposed to.  I drink it for breakfast some days when its hectic, and sometimes I have it as a snack.  It tastes better cold.  It is very thick, sometimes I put it in the blender with some ice to break up the thickness.  But then again, if I have time to do that, I usually just eat breakfast.  The aftertaste stays with you a while, so you might want some water to wash it down.  Right now (January 24) you can get these for $4.99 for a 4 pack at Target, which is a better price.  So check around for pricing.	1	1

1	B00028PPPU	A1YUL9PCJR3JTY	Nice Chamomile Tea	"****<br />Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as ""creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes.  Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""minty, hay like, rose"". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.<br />****"	1	0

We went back to Similac and have had no further problems.	0	3
1	B005A1LINC	ATECU14VUIOJ0	Wonderfully refreshing	Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito is a wonderfully refreshing non-alcholic drink.  The overall taste is smooth and tasty with a kick of mint that puts it over the top.  The 5 calories per serving is makes this a good choice for serving the gang on those hot summer afternoons.  Each small packets makes 2 quarts and are easily portable so they can be tucked into a purse or picnic basket & reconstituted at the park or beach.  You can also pour a small amount into your bottled water and shaken at your desk for an afternoon break.  I was surprised at how much I liked the taste of this Mocktail and am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors by Crystal Light.	0	0
-1	B004K677OW	A1W6X2SN2HCRE	Great product but needs to be completely sealed	"These bread crumbs taste great and bake well.  I'm only able to give this product 1 star because the plastic bag which holds the bread crumbs inside the box, is not sealed completely.  There is a 3/4"" gap at the top of the seam that runs up and down the bag.  I ordered this product thru the subscription so I received 3 boxes in one shipment.  All three boxes had the same gap (opening) in the plastic bag. This product needs to be completely sealed to ensure freshness and self-stability."	2	1
1	B006W5WH5S	A11NM2MWVX83WO	Delicious	This is one of the best snacks I have ever had. It has just enough filling to satisfy my sugar craving. Tastes like a crispy pop tart (no heating required).  I am on Weight Wathcers so I really appreciate the fact that 1 pack is only 2 points. It really hits the spot when you have a taste for something sweet. My co-workers are all in love with this treat.  They are hard to find, but we have found them in Pathmark (NYC). Only drawback is they are a little expensive.	2	0
-1	B004OAZ36I	A1QQTVXS00QZBX	Ok, varies.	This was good because it did give you a different kind of k cup and not too many of the same kind.<br /><br />The packaging can be improved as it comes in a box and inside all the assortment is in a brown bag. I understand they pick the different k cups from their boxes of flavors, but it could be presented better.<br /><br />Okay deal for the price.	0	0
1	B003C25ASK	A1PL0PBCQ6YC9E	This is not a pine honey	I was looking for Rigoni Di Asiago Pine honey since it disappeared from my local stores. When I finally ordered it - I got Forest honey of the same brand. Forest honey is exceptionally good, but still not as good as Pine. So my 4 stars apply for Forest and I would give 5 stars to Pine. Now picture is for Pine and the description is for Forest. At the time of my purchase it was Pine in the description too. There is no way anyone can get Asiago Piney honey now as it was discontinued by manufacturer. I still highly recommend Forest for it is quality and very interesting, I would even say - intriguing taste. As a proof I only can say that I've finished one jar in a two days.	0	0
1	B0008IT46A	A3FXF9M2AOD068	Tastier Salt	I found this salt on a discount bin and wondered if I should get two of them. Of course, I purchased only one thus kicking myself!<br /><br />This salt is fantastic!<br /><br />Regular iodized salt that we are used to is mild and somewhat bitter. This salt is completely different! Large salt crystals (similar to the Kosher pickling salt size) are perfect for meats, stews and bagels; by putting this in a salt grinder makes this suitable for all other uses.<br /><br />Note: the taste is very salty, strong and finishes slightly sweet.<br /><br />It does not take much of this salt to flavor the dishes so only use about 2/3rds of what you would use regular salt in your recipes.	3	0

1	B0045XE32E	A19DW3VKM5KKYB	My dog LOVES them - no wheat, corn, or soy	First of all, our dog Sheila cannot get enough of these. Seriously, I just got a 10-ounce bag today and she got very greedy after getting a taste. This is a healthy, organic treat that we don't have to feel guilty about feeding (in moderation) to our three year old pointer.<br /><br />My wife and I try to provide good nutrition for our dog. Corn, wheat, and soy are basically useless filler when it comes to dogs. They can't digest it, and furthermore many dogs are allergic to wheat. These Newman's Own Ranch Style treats do not contain any of those ingredients. They also do not contain any artificial additives, not for flavoring or coloring.<br /><br />Also important: these treats are NOT a product of China. I would sooner prepare all my dog's food from scratch than feed her any dog food/treats produced in China. These treats are a product of New Zealand.<br /><br />Grains are not an essential part of a dog's diet, but the one grain included in these treats - organic barley - is (from what I understand) generally an acceptable one. It's the first ingredient, followed by lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. Again, all organic. And that's it - very simple.	0	1
1	B000LL0R92	A36OP55DVALPB2	If you love the taste of lychee..	Then you will LOVE this. It actually tastes more like lychee and coconut rather than peach and mango!

1	B001KUVTM2	AX1Z5RQ1LWMM2	Control Yourself and You'll be Fine. May cause explosive diarrhea if you dont.	Let me say these are very good and very rich in taste which is good and bad.  By rich I don't mean if you look around the Monopoly guys house you would find a box of these.  So I found myself eating about eight in one minute which was quite excessive but man they were good.  Even my wife ate quite a few and we both agreed to put the bag up or we would finish it up.  Not a good thing since in four pieces I think there is fifteen grams of saturated fat and around two hundred forty calories.  We usually don't get sweets but when we do we indulge.  When you first eat one it tastes really good but after its been chewed the aftertaste sets in.  I did notice after a couple the taste gets unbearable so I had to drink something.  The dark chocolate is so rich that it is kind of overbearing after awhile but still they are very good.  I wouldn't say its my favorite chocolate but they do offer a certain taste I was looking and I am glad I bought them.  I wish there was a smaller bag to sample them with but we took a gander and really liked them.  Try them out and they might fit your taste.  If you are like me you will find yourself eating one after another which I don't recommend.  Oh yeah I did have major stomach cramps and a case of diarrhea afterwards but it was worth it just for those moments of bliss.  Thank you Donchels.	2	0
-1	B004ILKODA	A20SNYT3WFWTI2	Disappointed	I keep complaining about the K-Cups not being labeled light, medium or bold.

-1	B001E52YB8	AG78STGK47Y5S	Really bad	I was at work and out of coffee.  My coworker let me give this coffee a try.  I am a straight coffee drinker -- no cream or sugar added.  Disgustingly bitter dirty taste and a horrible aftertaste.  Floor sweeping would be more suitable to drink.	0	0
1	B000GAYE38	A2MMCH8JLHFX8Y	Great oatmeal at a fair price	We live on the road in a motorhome and travel the US. We found this particular brand of oatmeal in a store in Mesa, AZ. We loved it so much and couldn't find it when we got back to MN. Now, it is on AMAZON! What a shock to find it there. We really thought the price was good, except you have to buy so much.

1	B0014WYXQK	A3PCS59M8DKBTT	A tad too sweet for my taste	Izze makes some very good juices, and advertises that their juice contains nothing other than fruit juice and sparkling water.  These are undoubtedly far, far better for you than, say, a Coke or a Pepsi.  They taste better and are more refreshing, and they certainly have a more natural feel to them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that, like many juices that claim to be all fruit juice, the vast majority of the juice in this particular blend appears to be apple and grape, which are much sweeter fruits in comparison with the tarter flavors.  Everyone knows pomegranate is good for you, but my guess is that the percent of this juice that is actual pomegranate is quite small--perhaps as low as 2 or 3 percent--and so contrary to what other reviewers have said, any health advantages are quite minimal.<br /><br />All that being said, these are certainly a superior option to other soft drinks.  Just don't think these are as good as water.	0	0
1	B0026KNQSA	AEU9NQ5EDBW91	Great introduction to these chips	Okay, I personally loved how these chips taste. They are super crunchy and flavorful. I chose to take away one star because the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor was way too salty. BBQ was my favorite. Next time I order, I am getting just the BBQ. They taste just like the greasy unhealthier versions made by other brands. The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors.	0	0
1	B005HB4HGU	A11VH8PJ2MEHFV	Great salt	"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference."	16	1
1	B004ALIV7O	A3HED8SW5DDP9Q	Sweet only begins to describe it...more chocolate than you can imagine.	It is sooo chocolatey and rich that you can't eat more than a tiny piece.<br /><br />Slice it all out of the box in about half inch pieces and put it back in or serve it out of box, because if you try to slice it in the box and get a piece out in one piece it's impossible.<br /><br />It's just as described... layers of pastry in chocolate.<br /><br />When I got my small slice I found the best way to eat it was by peeling and eating the thin layers individually.  It is way to rich to eat a piece with a fork, can only eat a tiny bit at a time.<br />It is certainly different, richer and more chocolatey that anything I have ever experienced before...much richer than cheesecake.<br /><br />My niece just informed me the best way to serve it is to slice it as thin as you can.<br />If anyone out there knows how you're supposed to slice/serve it, let me know.	0	1

I stopped buying them years ago because they were way too expensive but at Amazon's price I'm now a subscription customer.  The only problem with these nuts is that once you open the can you don't want to stop eating them.  They have a Kona Coffee glaze and have just a hint of coffee flavor.

1	B001E52VLG	A2XNOB1T796Y6B	Delicious but not for stain magnets!	"As a new CL convert, I've taken it upon myself to sample all of the different flavors I can. On my latest grocery outing I discovered this little gem. It's cherry pomegranate with extra stuff added to it for immunity defense boosting reasons.<br /><br />Flavor wise, it's a-ok. It doesn't taste as ""natural"" as some of the other flavors, but it's still tasty. By ""natural"" I mean it tastes more like a Kool-Aid type of flavor, which should not be construed as a negative thing! Nothing but love for Kool-Aid in my house! This would be a great flavor to give to children on hot summer days, especially children who are prone to summer colds!<br /><br />The only negative side is the coloring. It's a lovely reddish color, very deep & rich looking. (I actually thought to recommend it to some of my vampire role playing friends!) It's just very easy to stain clothing, furniture & clothing with! I recommend a degree of caution when drinking this in anything that can't be bleached.<br /><br />Still, give this a chance! Yummy & good for you!"	1	1
1	B001N9V56K	A25SRMWUW673JQ	great flavor	This oil is light and delicious.  I've used it on pizza, scrambled eggs, and several other foods.  It just takes a small amount to add just the right amount of flavor.  I would certainly buy it again.	4	0
1	B0041CIR62	A3094EPI56GKZ6	Yummy	I love brown rice, and looking for more healthy grains in my diet- this cooks extremely fast and I was expecting more of a slimy product, but it was great! Made a chicken chili stir-fry, added these noodles it was extra yummy- Only downfall I can see is the price- A little pricey but for the health benefit its worth it !	0	1
1	B002N4O8WC	A31ZMQUIXKLE5G	My cats love this!	I have 3 cats, and they all love this food.  Their bowls are spotless when they finish eating!  They are all gravy fans, and I think that's part of the reason they love this so much--it has a LOT of gravy.  I like the ingredient list--I feel like my cats are getting good, quality food when I feed them this.  I'm glad to have finally found a food that my cats and I agree on!	1	0
-1	B0009X2AB0	A1Q0H5MOF4OQ6E	something changed	This food worked great for my two dogs up until about a year ago. Something changed in this food which caused both dogs severe diarrhea. Trialing them off and then on this food again caused the problems to return. We switched to a different brand.	0	0
-1	B000CQID1A	A1IATV65IYNK96	Okay	A good snack but became sick of it. The sticks are about 3 inches in length. A pack of 100 seems like a lot for a fair price.	2	0
1	B000FBQ594	A18ONS03Z126EH	Fab Biscuit	This is a great twist on the classic Tea biscuit by adding a cocoa filling. Downgraded only for the mild chocolate flavor typical of cocoa. They're crisp, they dunk without falling apart. Try a box you won't be disappointed.	0	0
1	B0030VBRCG	A10BAU1962PTFU	Baby loves it, its a little liquidy though	This is a fine product.  My daughter eats it right up and seems to enjoy it.  I will say however that it is very liquidy (no texture) so I have more drips when feeding her.  I wish it were a bit more solid in texture (I really like Plum Baby Food due to the texture).  Again, daughter loves it.	0	0

There is nothing he has written that is incorrect about this tea; HOWEVER, I enjoy adding just a bit of lemon to my Lady Grey tea.  BUT, you really don't need to add any lemon if you don't want to.<br /><br />THIS IS ONE OF THE  B-E-S-T  teas produced!  ENJOY!	0	0
1	B005MSH01C	A3GL3YDU9RE7IX	Closer than you think....	"Go to your local grocery store and buy some lime juice (I use the stuff that looks like a plastic lime with a tiny screw-top).  Make the cola as directed using the Sodastream.  Put a healthy squirt of the lime juice into the bottle and gently mix.  You'll almost swear that it's ""the real thing"".  This also works with most ""bargain brand"" cola products...<br /><br />I keep this syrup around in case I run out of ""the real thing"" and don't feel like going to the store.  The real stuff is better (and cheaper), but I'm really lazy.<br /><br />This syrup makes the equivalent of 3 2-liter bottles. (about $4.50).  Your choice."	0	0
1	B00117YTBC	A2L9G81KGUXOD7	Good stuff!	Although I have not made a comprehensive survey of all apple cider vinegars, this is the best from among the few that I have tried. Appears about as raw and natural as you would expect. Flavor is good, too.	7	0
1	B0018CFN92	A18AAABCIJKC5Q	Great dog food	"My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more ""bang for your buck"" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!"	8	0
1	B007JT7ARQ	A17K6WB5PGT3UV	Great Shampoo, Use it all the time now	This is one of those products I would have never given a try except it was sent to me in the Vine Program.<br />Now every one in my family uses it.<br /><br />I do not know how it works but it works good.

1	B004EAGP74	A3BDPPJ50IIEY0	Great Stuff	The coconut oil smelled like coconut and had no taste. It cooks well and and looks like lard but is healthier. I noticed when I used it for cooking that it adds a coconut scent to the food, so be careful if you don't want the smell on a certain food.	0	0

The icing tastes just like regular icing, if not better.  It doesn't leave that yucky aftertaste and a little goes a long way.  My customer's love it and are so surprised that it is sugar free and not made from sacharrin or anything bad for your health like that.	2	0

1	B003X0PT4Q	A364352K2XL4A1	Great Tea....	I've enjoyed this tea for years, and introduced it to many of my tea-drinking friends. The best Oolong tea available, in my honest opinion. And Amazon gave a better price to my door thanks to their super saver free shipping option for the bulk order over $25.00-better than the manufacturers' price and shipping cost.	0	0

1	B001FCFYU8	A38OCDJQOAQ2XG	Great Tea	I recently dropped coffee for tea. I bought some Moroccan mint to compliment my Stash double bergamot. The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way, it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it.	0	0
1	B003JA5KKS	A1MQESL5LGOKZW	My Favorite	I love this coffee.  As I get older, my stomach can't seem to take the really strong blends.  Breakfast Blend is perfect.  Great flavor without hurting my stomach.  Amazon has the best price with free shipping.  I only wish I could start an automatic refill of my order.<br /><br />Update 9-1-12<br />Yea!!! This coffee can finally be ordered with an automatic refill.  I am always guaranteed the lowest price and don't have to worry about searching for it.  I am one happy Amazon, coffee lover.	7	0

1	B000E39P9U	A3B6XDNF9HUMSJ	Works	I live in the tropics where biodegrading happens FAST! These bags worked without biodegrading in my trash can. They fit the can perfectly and actually stay in place unlike my old drawstring bags. I have chosen to amend my stuff everything you can fit into the bag philosophy and so far (1 box used) have had no breaks or leaks. I am surrounded by the ocean and I rarely forget that we are literally trashing our oceans daily. It feels good knowing I can do one less harmful thing and is certainly worth the change.	1	0
1	B004RZ63KK	AJMUKYFG008DZ	Love True Lemon	My husband and I both love the taste of True Lemon.  We use it in our ice tea on a daily basis. It tastes as if you just squeezed a fresh lemon in your glass and it is so much more convenient. We haven't had time to use it in other ways but understand it is excellent to use in lemony desserts from lemon pudding to lemon pie.	0	0
-1	B002NHYQAS	AZ5X928CQPRJN	Disappointing Dark	"I found this bar rather lacking in chocolate flavor.  At 54%, it might be possible that I am used to a higher cocoa content (60%+).  While some other reviewers have mentioned the mouthfeel as ""grainy"", I found it more chalky.  It melted well in the mouth without any grainy feel, but when chewed, became a rather gummy mass of chocolate.  It wasn't awful by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a little strange.  If you don't like dark chocolate, you would probably enjoy this bar--it seemed more like semi-sweet chocolate to me.  If you like dark chocolate, however, prepare for disappointment."	1	1
1	B0034EDMCW	AL48B8964O9YV	The Best!	"I am pleased with this product.  I have diabetes and carry a bar in my purse--just in case I might need.

1	B003B3OOPA	A3YHN4DKZS7WN	Coocoo for Coconut Oil!	Great product!  I use it for cooking and in my smoothies.  The flavor is wonderful, and it always seems to bring out the natural flavors of meat and seafood.  It has also helped me control and lose weight.  I weighed in at 205 lbs at the beginning of the year and with proper diet, exercise and a spoonful of coconut oil daily, I have lost 25 lbs.  If you want to cut out salt and sugar from your diet but not taste, try cooking with coconut oil.  It will enhance the flavors of your food and help you fix those nasty cravings.	2	0
1	B006MONQMC	A2VH0UT5EQFB6P	Tastes Good	This is not nearly as concentrated as the MIO water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water.  But, you get a lot more of it (12 oz) and one 1/2 fluid oz. squirt has 120% daily requirement for vitamin C and no calories.  The fruit punch tastes good, however I like my water to be very weakly flavored so I probably put in about a 1/2 squirt giving me 60% of my daily requirement for vitamin C.<br /><br />It's mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin C, but there are more things beside vitamin C in it:<br /><br />Vitamin C - 120%<br />Vitamin B6 - 40%<br />Vitamin B5 - 40%<br />Vitamin B3 - 40%<br />Vitamin B12 - 40%<br />Zinc - 10%<br />Chromium - 10%<br /><br />The plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze.  This might be a good way to get some needed vitamin C without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin C pills.  And, if you like your water flavored but are particular like me, about how much flavor is in it, then this is a good way to control it.	0	1
1	B004DN9LCS	A166CNCHL42AOE	Excellent Blend	The Caribou Coffee K-Cup is an excellent blend of strong coffee. It's not for everyone. I'd recommend it to those who like stronger coffees, and even espressos.	0	0

-1	B001AWBL82	A2H4CEWK1963O9	Over priced sticks of salt	I love all different types of beef jerky, but not this one.  It has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt. These sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew, but they're just way too salty and definitely not worth $20	2	2

1	B004SF356E	AVK8NCLIBYKXD	Surprised there are no reviews for this excellently addictive snack	I was looking for roasted green peas that were not Wasabi for my wife.  I know ... crazy ... but she actually doesn't care for wasabi.  Anyway - she was looking for a healthy snack and I recently noticed a nutrition expert on television recommend roasted green peas so I looked to track some down for a good price.  Most of those offered via Amazon Prime were wasabi or had inconsistent reviews.  Decided to take a chance on this item ... so far not reviewed.  Well - I need not look any further.  This one is a winner.  Peas are the perfect crunchy but not too crunchy texture.  Seasoning is very light but just right.  And one can eat 55 of them as one serving - I weighed them.  Not only is my wife fond of them - my kids are as well.  And, although I had picked up another brand of wasabi peas, I had a hard time staying out of this can when one was open.  This one is a keeper.	0	0

1	B001D0GV90	A2G7F7JZMFO56Y	Best k-cup for those who like it strong	I drink only dark, strong coffee. I've had no success finding a k-cup that is even worth drinking prior to trying this one. I typically use the Cuisinart grind and brew with a dark and oily French roast bean. That is about the only way I have my daily coffee. I tried using the little filter in the Keurig with my own coffee, but it still would not come out strong enough. The k-cups are so convenient, and I am extremely happy that I can finally use that machine now that I've discovered this Midnight Magic blend.	1	0

1	B0083T5TAQ	A1JWG3CE2PQVSM	Amazing !	"With all these bad reviews, you'd think this would be a bad product. I didn't think so at all. I got 22 different kinds. The other two cups were mudslide. There was one flavor out of 23 that I didn't enjoy. The blueberry flavor was absolutely awful. My boyfriend liked it though, so no complaints here! I will definitely purchase this again.<br /><br />For all you people that receive 4 - 5 of the same cups, you should have read the reviews first. If you did, and thought ""Huh, I'll take a chance"", it's your own fault. I'd rather get this even if I got only four different kinds. Its better than an entire box of the SAME kind."	0	0
-1	B006N3I1HM	A2TJG4N8LNJW23	Am I drinking the same coffee as the 5-star reviewers?	I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.	0	0

-1	B001KUSLGY	A2Q59LT13UUKJT	Zevia, Natural Cola with ERYTHRITOL	I recently purchased a case of Zevia.  I was anxious to try out this product.  It arrived today, much to my delight.  After drinking just a half of a can, I came down with a terrible headache.  I couldn't believe it.  The culprit...ERYTHRITOL, a sugar alcohol, the second ingredient in the product; not STEVIA, the fifth ingredient. Also, the product is purported to have -0- calories.  Erythritol contains 2.6 calories per gram.  There are 12 grams of erythritol in each can.  Most erythritol is made from fermenting GMO corn.  How healthy is that? This beverage is VERY expensive and would be well worth it if it were truly an all natural<br />drink, sweetened only with stevia, which is what I thought I purchased.	68	22
1	B001CTYT6E	A10GTLAY7TZDQ6	great jerky!	Ostrim beef-ostrich jerky tastes great and isn't sweet like most jerkeys. It has only 60 calories and is very low in fat and carbs. It's delicious and excellent for a high-protein diet. The price is quite reasonable and it's a healthy snack or mini-meal. I've tried only the pepper variety and love it. I've ordered twice and will continue.	0	0

1	B000G1CPV0	A1FZB9JT78ZTDZ	A soup that tastes not like a can	Healthy, Natural, Organic, Low-fat and it tastes good? One might find one or two of these qualities in a product and then find themselves willing to sacrifice good taste for a healthy choice, or low-fat for an organic and delicious meal. However with Amy's Minestrone Soup, one need not sacrifice any of these. In fact to describe the home-cooked flavor and the hearty filling ingredients of this delicacy is a task best left suited to the taste buds. It's simply unfortunate that they are unable to talk!<br />Not only is this can of soup akin to a home cooked meal, it is also easy to prepare (only minutes in a microwave or stove-top), and perfect for quick lunches or for a last minute dinner. Of course it could also be passed off as if the preparer had labored hours in the kitchen, preparing the pasta, slicing the vegetables and carefully adding the spices to prepare a soup worthy enough to be called Mom's.<br />Finally, it is very low in fat (only 3 grams a can!) and has lots of fiber and a minimal calorie count. So one can slim out, eat well and know they are eating only the best organic food items!	5	0

-1	B004UD69H6	A2Q79J76PISBAJ	Crammed full of Sugar - 29g per can!	I spent days trying to find decent coconut water/juice in order to make shakes, and since I'm a health nut, I try to control my sugar intake. Every coconut water product I looked at is full of sugar, and this brand is no different. An amazing 29 grams of sugar per can. Also, this product is only 70% juice! What's the other 30 percent? An average can of soda contains 30 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened coconut water, but I can't find it. Why in the world do manufactures feel the need to sweeten things that are already fine and sweet? Alright, maybe a little sugar, but 29grams? I'm drinking this because I care about my health and don't want to drink soda! Leave it to them to take something perfect the way it is, and make it just as bad as soda! Don't wonder why they don't post this nutritional information on the product page; they don't want you to know it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake. Very sweet, but these manufacturers don't understand that you don't need to add so much sugar to a naturally sweet product! There IS a market for unsweetened coconut water, guys.	3	0
1	B002RTNBSA	A3AOKQCH0YBZDS	Great Tasting Jasmine Green Tea!!	I was skeptical about trying this product as I usually don't like bottled tea products. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product tasted. I am an avid jasmine green tea drinker and found this product a refreshing alternative to freshly brewed tea. I love the aroma and taste of this item and that no sugar or artificial sweeteners have been added to it. Best of all this product is great refrigerated to enjoy on hot days!	0	0
1	B002RZ1QBI	A3W1IA4S68FYW9	Nice Ice Wine!!	First off, this kit produces 30-375ml bottles of wine, not the advertised 30-750ml bottles of wine.. Also, this is not a 13.5lb box, it's a 13.5kg box which equals 30lb. It does not require the addition of any water. The main juice bag is 9L, and the F-Pack (sweetening pack) is 3L.. That being said, you will need a 3 gal carboy in order to make this wine, along with all the other necessary equipment. The finished product is very good! Like any ice wine, this is very sweet, and meant to be sipped along with a dessert. It fermented from 1.114 to 0.990 in just over 3 weeks, and after adding the sweetening pack, it was 1.060, so it's like drinking candy! I've tasted a few different ice wines from the finger lakes, and this is right on par with them. This is the first Ice Wine I have made, so I can't compare it to any of the other kits available from other manufacturers.. The color of this wine looks like a whiskey. With free shipping this is a bargin price for an Ice Wine.. Normally in the store, these go for roughly $15.00-$25.00/375ml bottle, and these cost $2.00/375ml bottle!!<br /><br />I will be ordering this again!	6	0
1	B002WWHXZO	AM6O5UTNX3SDH	Starbucks Breakfast Blend	We have been searching for a replacement for the coffee we previously used, which has been discontinued.  This blend fits the bill!  We really like the flavor.  Glad to have discovered it.	0	0
1	B0030VJA7K	AZNSBRQ0DS8LK	Great Snack For Babies & Toddlers!	We have been buying these melts for about 7-8 months now for our daughter. They do tend to go fast, and since they are pricey we buy them sparingly and give them to her as a special treat. No funky ingredients in these that you cannot pronounce. I love how you know exactly what you are giving your child with these (and bonus, NO artificial colors/dyes!). I definitely recommend them as an addition to your diaper bag essentials. They keep my daughter busy when she is getting antsy while out running errands. Overall a great snack to have on hand for your little one(s)!	0	0
-1	B003YBJ9KY	A37GZRJUDMMF0	Crap	Go picnic by the box is a horrible item!  It is expensive, not a balanced meal as stated, and is full of carbs.  Definitely not worth ordering.  I only ordered once and they send it to me monthly, can't return can't seem to stop the orders.  They never stated it was an automatic  monthly shipment or that it was non return.  What a hassle and disappointment of amazon.  I'll think twice before using amazon shopping again!  And good luck with customer service!  Go picnic products ugh!	1	7
1	B003V8Y7DE	A3RAR9FI50HT8P	Delicious	I tried these once and came to Amazon to order more because they don't sell them where I live.  They're a healthy alternative to chips, with great flavor!  I love that they only have 3 ingredients.  They're similar to rice cakes only thinner, and have achip-like crisp/crunch.  I was surprised to find the size of the bags, assuming they were small bags.  The 5 ounce bag is almost the size of regular chip bags, not individual bags.	0	0
1	B004HOLD4W	A2754OLX4JI486	Jalepeno Goodness	If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These particular almonds pack a lot of flavor and kick.  They are great for a quick snack that is full of flavor.  They are delicious.	2	0
1	B001ELL67A	A1OI591Q6AO3WV	Great!	I bought the Kuerig coffee brewer a year ago. My wife loves the variety pack. For me, however, there is only one coffee. Tully's French Roast is perfect roast. I can get it other places, but Amazon's just drops it at my front door. How great is that?!?	0	0
-1	B000VK4K3W	A2KEES9I8NTSTP	No Savings	I ordered the cat food online because of the savings and convenience but will not order again because there were 3 damaged cans. It ended up being more expensive than buying in the store.	2	1
1	B000E243R0	A2UT2PZWSI862S	Great snack!!	Very pleased with the taste of these!! Hubby ate 9 of the 12 mini-bags in about a week, so I guess they also pass the picky husband test. Ordering more now!	3	0

These chips are bursting with flavor, and you can't really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!!	1	0

1	B004TPKAN4	A3W4D8XOGLWUN5	Ginger Snap!!!!!	There is no question that Newman's Own has made some really outrageous and clever cusisine, but it has been benefiting so many people for years. But when I heard about their cookies, I was absolutely very skeptical about them. Their Family Recipe Ginger Snaps, really bring out the ginger of the gingersnap cookies. Each cookie, really tastes like you smelling a freshly minced piece from ginger root. It is that strong, in fact a bit too strong for kids, but not for adults. They do taste good, but I do think kids might be a bit turned off with the cookies though because of the strong ginger root smell and taste. Still, Newman's Own does really make it worth its while, and I do recommend you give Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps a try.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+	1	0

1	B0026SLLFC	A3IOT14GHWD6J7	Nice cheese	I received this cheese from Emmi, Boska and Culture magazine.  It is a two pound wheel, nicknamed Monk's Head, for it's small, round shape.  It's full flavored and melts quite well.  It is traditionally used on a girolle, or cheese curler, to make pretty curled ribbons of cheese for a beautiful presentation.  I like it melted with potatoes as well.  A nice hearty cheese for cool winter nights.	0	0
1	B001LGGH40	A39E7IWNHY62JT	My family loves this drink!  Better than soda.	This drink is a nice change of pace from soda.  It is an all NATURAL beverage with NO JUNK IN IT.  It is made only of juice and carbonation and that is it.  We couldn't believe it when we tried it!  It tastes really great and if I were looking for a drink without caffeine I would choose this.  The Switch is really tasty and satisfying.  I also liked that the carbonation is not quite as heavy as some sodas.  My family of four tried it and we all decided that we would buy this brand again.	0	0

1	B001TLY7A8	A3CCUEQSRIL7NV	Paw Lickin Indeed!	My two boy kitties LOVE this food...they have been eating it for a couple months now and they still meow like crazy when they hear us opening the cans!  We mix in just a little bit of dry food with it and they clean their dishes every time!  And one of the kitties would turn his nose up at everything we tried, but he really loves this food!!<br />We are very happy to have found it.<br />Update: They STILL LOVE IT!  We've tried other canned foods just to mix it up for them, but nothing makes them happier than this chicken.	1	0
-1	B003YBLF2E	A9RNCQ37W8BAA	Naz-tay	"What really brings down my rating is the below cat food grade ""Chili Lime Salmon"". I mean, how can you go wrong with Chili Lime Salmon? That sounds absolutely delicious. I guess it doesn't translate well into a non-refrigerated slush. It tastes very cheap and fishy. I was expecting something on the level of canned tuna but this stuff is inedible. I couldn't finish it, so I gave it to my mom who eats anything and she said no thank you. I gave it to my cats and they sniffed it, then backed away slowly. My only other option would be to give it to the homeless people near my house, but I genuinely think they would be angry at me if I gave them this stuff. In short, stay away from the seafood slurry included in this box.<br /><br />For some reason, I don't care for the crackers that come with this either. I usually love multigrain crackers, but these taste like cardboard covered in a shiny egg wash.<br /><br />The fruit and nut mix was okay, but not as good as the Baja Blend in other GoPicnic boxes. I also taste zero ginger even though it's called ""Ginger Zip"".<br /><br />The Edamame wasn't bad either. I would eat more of it.<br /><br />The Buttercrunch Toffee was the best thing in the box. I wish someone mispackaged my boxes and included nothing but the toffee. Me want more.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this box again. I'd just get the toffee...and some more of that Baja Blend nut mix."	0	0
-1	B002C1Y5GU	A33GBMWX8VH1MJ	Cat loves it, but it STINKS horribly	I've been feeding my cat this food for about 2 weeks and my cat loves it. However, I feed my cat in the dining room and I eat my breakfast in the living room because the food stinks and the smell lingers.<br /><br />My cat seems very healthy and always has lots of energy after his meal. He seems very healthy and excited to be fed and licks the can clean.<br /><br />But I think I'll return to Tiki Cat or Newman's Own. I change his litterbox at least twice per day because I will not have my house smelling like animal droppings. I will not tolerate foul cat food smell either.	0	3
1	B0061UQ0G6	A1F7YU6O5RU432	Tastes just like the Tazo Awake tea bags	If you enjoy the bold black tea Awake made by Tazo, you're going to love it just as much in these super convenient K-Cups. You get the exact same great strong flavor as you do from using the tea bags. I like my tea strong, and I find I can actually make about 1 and a half mugs of tea from each of these K-Cups, and still get a good strength. Another cheaper option is simply buying a box of the Tazo Awake tea bags and just use your Keurig to make the hot water for your tea, then just add a tea bag to it. But if you like using the K-Cups, you will be happy with the cup of tea these produce. I've used up about half of one of these boxes so far, and only once did I end up with any tea leave in my cup. There were just a few, and it only happened one time so far, so I think it's not that common an occurrence. It didn't affect the cup of tea at all, I just always check to see when I'm trying out new K-Cups how clear of a drink they produce. In all, Tazo has produced a better of a cup of tea than I've brewed from other brands of K-Cups, such as Twinings Earl Grey, which came out cloudy and weak.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the taste of this blend, it's a strong black tea with no real flavors to speak of. There's no citrus, no sweetness, nothing like that. If I was to compare it to coffee, it would be like a basic, black coffee with nothing added to it. Because of it's simple taste, this is a great anytime tea and a great replacement for coffee.	2	0

1	B003IHO8LY	A96R0U8IM7K3H	Night Shift Godsend	I bought a single bottle at my local store to try. I fell asleep before I finished the bottle. I bought a few more bottles but when I went back a few days later they were out and didn't have any for a week so went on line and happily found it here. Not only do I fall asleep with no problem if I wake up in the middle of my sleep I don't have any problem going back to sleep. I'm not groggy when I wake up either. I have been working night shift for 20 years and have tried a lot of things to help sleep over the years and this is hands down the best. Worth every cent. Buying from Amazon means I never have to worry about being out since my local store couldn't keep it in stock. Obviously, I wasn't the only one who thinks it is a necessity.	1	0
-1	B0046HHRT0	AKBLSWAIXFY2O	Not the best of Pamela's brand	"I ordered the Pamela's Butter Shortbread because I have tried a few varieties of Pamela's cookies and been very impressed. Upon opening the package I was quickly let down. The plastic container that the cookies are in is much bigger than the cookies themselves. It looks as if they have somehow shrunk up! These cookies are very crumbly (maybe the agave in them?) so you need to have a napkin near when eating them. Taste-wise they are good. They don't have any strange ""gluten free flour"" taste which is a definite plus. They did seem a bit too sugary for me though. It felt like my throat was burning because of the sugar (again, maybe this is because the agave).<br /><br />If you really need a cookie fix and no other gluten free cookies are near then these are worth a try. If you are able to get your hands on any other Pamela cookies though then steer clear of these."	0	0
1	B00068PCTU	AEUTF9X5A9RE8	Best stevia product I ever used	I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.<br /><br />I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good.	0	0

There is little to no difference between the supposed ""flavors"". They don't taste juicy, like the Black forest. They taste sugary and acidic but not fruity. Worst of all, there is an underlying bitter, chemical taste to them that just completely ruins it. They do look pretty, but that's about the only thing they have going for them."	4	7
1	B001FSJCPK	A201EYZDN51A0B	Life Savers!!	We have a Bengal. They are known to be smarter, feistier and more opinionated than the average cat. When ours was struck with a sudden mystery illness that caused acute life threatening anemia - after a week in the hospital he came home with a strict and huge pill routine.<br /><br />For two weeks we fought, got bit, scratched, foamed on, etc. we tried liquids. Pills. Hiding them in food. Hiding them in other treats. Everything. He wasn't getting his meds - he'd throw them up. Foam them all out. Eat around them, etc.<br /><br />As a last hope we tried the pill pockets. I figured he was WAY too smart for this trick. The pills he takes are huge and foul smelling - I couldn't imagine he'd not smell them or not bite into them whole eating it.<br /><br />But - they worked!! And not just once - every time. He's going to be on steroids for probably a year, and into month 3 he still takes his 3 pills daily with pleasure! Talk about a literal life saver, we wouldn't have made it without them.	0	0

It brought back fond memories. It tasts as good as ever and it seems the new producer has kept to the original receipe. Its not sweet but can be modified to taste. A must for the kitchen staple of condoments. I incorperate a teaspoon into a homemade hamburger patty and grill as usual and WOW!.	1	0

It's dark, rich, and strong, but not so strong that it has me bouncing off the walls after a few cups of it. If you like extra-bold coffee, you may want to try this. I think it may appeal to those who like either strong or medium blends. It's delicious!	2	0

This milk is the best of not only powdered milks. But it's the best milk I've ever had. I use a shaker type Blender Bottle to make it. I try to make it a few hours before I need/want it. I like to give it time to chill. Also I've never had to throw any of this milk away. It has a fresh, creamy taste and is a tiny bit sweet. Really, it's better than any store bought milk.	0	0
1	B001BDDTB2	A3DA0BTIGT3WG5	MMMEEEEEEOOOOWWWW!!	Let me start here by admitting that we have 5 cats that live with us now (I know, don't even ask it's a loooong story).  I've always been a big fan of the Fancy Feast and recently the fishier varieties of the Aristocats soft foods.  On occasion I will purchase Friskies but honestly I just can't stand the smell of the latter, even if the kitties just love it.<br /><br />Just for a fun little test I decided to put three cans out, to see which was favored by my cats (Fancy Feast, Aristocats and this Petite Cuisine).  Well, long story short, they gobbled this brand up, quick as quick before moving on to their usual favorites.<br /><br />This brand looks and for the most part smells similar to canned tuna, one of them even has tiny whole shrimp. Bonus!! They eat it all up, so no kitty food sitting in the bowl when they are done. It is made from quality ingredients, not full of ash (like some), has added vitamins and the texture & smell that the cats really enjoy.  I admit that quality cat food has gotten a bit on the expensive side but, this isn't bad at all considering the prices of the other comparable brands.  All in all my kitties really enjoyed this food & I will certainly be back for more.	0	0

1	B0025VRTG0	A34IT7UOZ2DSOV	Greatest thing since sliced bread	I've been buying Trinidad Cookquick Refried Pinto Beans for over 2 years, and I have never been disappointed with the quality, and taste of these beans. They take only 5 to 10 minutes to prepare, which, in my experience, depends on your consistency preference when preparing the product. They taste excellent without additional seasonings, but they're fantastic when prepared to one's taste with added seasonings etc. I prepare them with jalepenos, cheese, and some chipotle seasoning to add a bit of a kick to them. They're even better if one adds just a little cooked chorizo and cheddar cheese. I've served these to guests as a side with dinner and as a simple dip. In my experience, every guest that has tasted and eaten these beans cannot distinguish these dehydrated refried beans from traditionally prepared refried pinto beans. In fact, my mother, who is Hispanic and regularly prepares refried beans from scratch, could not tell the difference. I highly recommend this product for its quality, flavor, price, and convenience. Again, they're fantastic.<br /><br />A side note worth mentioning: When I purchased these beans locally, the only store that carried them WAS Smart & Final. Unfortunately, the Smart & Final stores in my area can't stock their shelves fast enough to keep up with the demand.	0	0

1	B000LKXA2O	A2E3WMF9RWW2X2	Best peanut butter replacement.	I tried the unsweetened soybutter about 3 years ago.  I gagged!  Then a year after that, my young son was diagnosed with peanut allergy.  So, we have lots of this in our house.  I just bought the unsweetened version for myself, everyone else in the family likes the sweet ones.  I put about a tablespoon with jam on bread and you have the perfect peanut butter replacement.  I do not notice the lack of sugar.  I also have the Clown Gysin soy butter too.  It has a good flavor as well.  I think they put more oil in theirs since that version has more fat in it than the IM Healthy.  That is what makes the Clown Gysin version more peanut buttery sweetened than the IM Healthy.  Right now this is my favorite.	1	0
1	B0019978P6	A22IG0MGKBN9W1	Supremely Delicious!	This is the second time I have purchased this 5-pound bag of Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Coffee, Frenchy French, whole beans so I can grind them myself.  Don't let the name throw you, it's not like a usual French roast, bitter with oily double-cracked beans.  It's supremely smooth with a moderate intensity of flavor and no bitterness.  I make a ball jar full by the drip method through a cone.  I have a cup with honey and whole milk in the morning and the remainder gets cold; it's even smooth when cold!  That's the sure sign of a great coffee -- it's when the professional coffee tasters sample their coffees, when they're cold.  So don't hesitate on this one.  Take it from someone who searches for the perfect cup of coffee, and has finally uncovered the great devise.  That it's fair trade is an added bonus.  Organic is essential!  The foregoing is no exaggeration!	3	0
-1	B002FJM9SU	A2P7B00G8SB2O4	THE ARSENIC WORRY	"I'm a mother of two young babies who were fed this formula for 6 months.  At the time I purchased and used this formula in 2009-2010, I was incredibly happy and confident that I had found the perfect formula for my babies.  It smelled and tasted different from other formulas that we had tried on our babies.  I compared all the nutrient labels and believed that it was equivalent to other formulas commercially sold.  I told everyone I knew about the product, encouraging other mothers to use it for their babies.  Since learning of the arsenic in Nature's One formulas, I'm angry and very scared about the possible health effects as a result of my babies ingesting this arsenic through the formula.  This is the only way I know how to deal with some of my emotions--let other mothers know about this very important issue.<br /><br />I'm not a ""hired writer"" (but I'm certain that the mere fact that I'll be accused of it again by the company and its followers will be enough ""proof"" for some).  This seems to be the common term the company and its followers are using on many of the online forums like Amazon and Facebook to label and harass mothers who have been brave enough to raise questions about the safety of the product.  For all the truly worried-sick mothers asking too many questions, this is a debate that must be carried on despite the tediousness of the continuous harassment by the company and its followers because the safety of our babies and an entire generation of people are at risk.  The company and its followers are successfully getting postings deleted from online forums in order to suppress thoughts and opinions that it doesn't like because they raise important and valid issues.  Apparently, we're asking some of the right questions--questions that require answers that the company doesn't want to give to parents.  It's not just about this company however.  This is just the starting point.  It's about getting the truth out of the FDA and getting our government to set definable and safe standards for arsenic in our food.<br /><br />First, as unfortunate as it was to discover that there is arsenic in baby formula, it is only the tip of the iceberg.  As I've devoted my time to researching and reading scientific papers and articles, I am just starting to understand that arsenic in our food supply is more prevalent and more dangerous than the public realizes.  The scientific communities around the world have been studying and writing about the dangers of long term arsenic poisoning from water and food for years, and yet it's a fact that most people weren't even aware of until now.  How many of us knew that the U.S. standard for arsenic in our water supply was set at the level it is now (10 parts per billion) not because it was the lowest and safest level that could be achieved, but because the government agency responsible did a cost analysis and determined that it would be too expensive to remove more arsenic than that from our water supply?<br /><br />I suppose it shouldn't be surprising given the fact that the FDA has been ""monitoring arsenic in foods for 20 years"" (yes, it has known about arsenic in chicken meat for years) but has never taken actions until now to limit this toxin in our food supply.  I guess that the majority of the public (who aren't involved in this debate over Nature's One's formula) will continue on with their lives without ever knowing about the negative health effects of ingesting arsenic every day through water and food.  The majority of us will live a reasonable number of years and suddenly find out that we have some form of cancer, and think it was predominantly genetics that determined our illness, never dreaming that it could've been the arsenic in our food and water.  Regardless of the reasons why the FDA and various agencies never acted to protect the people from arsenic toxicity, it's enough to know that scientific communities have been urging governments to set ""safe"" standards to limit the amount of arsenic consumption.  It's intolerable to think that the government has been allowing this to go on for so long.  Isn't it time that we demand better from the government of the greatest nation on earth?<br /><br />As I step back from all the debate over whether Nature's One's organic formula is safe or not, I realize that this will be an ongoing war of words.......with no immediate winners.  I imagine that the only thing we'll be left to deal with will be the long term health problems of a small percentage of babies who were unlucky enough to have been fed this formula.  It's sad to think that by simply refusing to admit that the levels of arsenic found in its formulas are unsafe, the company is possibly jeopardizing the health of many babies.  We as parents did the research on all the available formulas and decided to trust this company with our babies' health.  We believed that we were getting the best formula on the market for our babies; we trusted that this organic company was testing for dangerous toxins like arsenic in its products.  Naturally, we trusted, never imagining that an organic company would sell an organic product containing brown rice syrup that was made from rice grown in soil contaminated with arsenic.<br /><br />As of yesterday, the company has decided to release its test results on its website.  I read the numbers, and at first, it meant nothing to me.  I did some research and tried to understand what this truly meant.  From what I was able to find online, my understanding was that the WHO standards that the company cites as safe (2.1 mcg/kg of bodyweight/daily) were set in 1983 and were based on standards for arsenic in water that were much higher (50 parts per billion) than the current standard of 10 parts per billion.  Arsenic experts from around the world agree that this standard is outdated and needs to be revised using ""a firm scientific basis.""  According to experts, this WHO standard is a ""fallback position"" due to the lack of current standards for arsenic in food, and not one that is necessarily safe.<br /><br />My fears about what the future may hold for my babies in terms of their health keep me up at nights.  I wonder, and I'm sad about what I might have done to them in my quest for the best.  I only pray and hope that all the babies around the world who were fed this formula will show the amazing resiliency of the human species, and that we as their parents will have the strength to deal with whatever may come.<br /><br />Articles:<br />""Arsenic and Rice""<br />""Getting to the Bottom of Arsenic Standards and Guidelines""<br />""A Bitter Sweetner in Baby Formula""<br />""Arsenic, Organic Foods, and Brown Rice Syrup"""	3	2

1	B004C1VJEO	A15H0AKC63CPXQ	yes ... long pepper taste and very good chocolate	I think this is my favorite, perhaps in lifetime. Absolutely love it, but as previous reviewer mentioned, pepper really lasts long on the tongue, which I like. Yeahhh ... I think you should go for it, why not. Love the fact that its not extremely sweet, for my sake it could even get more bitter. Mmmmmm! Also, I would never give one star only to an item that has dark chocolate in it ... Dark chocolate! Cannot really be a one star. Ever. Period.	0	1
1	B003P83JMU	AATWFX0ZZSE6C	Had higher hopes...still not bad.	So, I am a big fan of coffee concentrate and my wife and I avail ourselves during the summer months mainly of Cool Brew, which is the same concept, but can be used as a hot beverage as well.  This product is slightly less expensive and easier to order through Prime and you don't have to order as much to get the better price.  But I found that it was weaker and required more of the extract to produce a flavorful beverage.  Cool Brew also comes in flavors, we prefer the Mocha. I wanted this to work as an alternative, but am thinking no.  The flavor is okay, but 3 ounces provides no where near what I feel is the necessary ratio when mixing with milk and ice for and iced latte type of effect.  You need more like 6 or 7 ounces almost making the cost higher than Cool Brew.  Go ahead and mix 3 ounces with a clear liquid and you will see it ends up looking like tea, not coffee and just does not get the job done.  But that is my view and chances are I like a hardier taste than others.  If this were all that was available, I would probably get it because once mixed properly it is not bad and still the cost is less than Starbucks.  At $10+ for two ventis yesterday, that is not a hard threshold to achieve. People who are satisfied with a milder coffee beverage would probably be happy with this product as the former reviews indicate.	0	0

The figures lack detail because of the sour stuff.  The first box I opened contained two transparent plastic packets of five pieces each.  The first packet had all Mario and Yoshi.  The second packet had all Donkey and Diddy Kong.  Mario and Yoshi were Strawberry and Mixed berries.  Donkey and Diddy Kong were Watermelon and Orange.  They were all yummy!  The packaging is exactly as pictured.	0	0
-1	B007I7Z3Z0	A27ULPK1RGCNU6	Yes from me, No from my husband	Have to give it 3 stars as I thought it wasn't bad but my husband hated the after taste. It does have a little bit of an after taste but I didn't think it was too bad. My husband disagreed. So if you want something different than plain water or soda give this a try.	0	0
-1	B003CG16WK	AH5JCLB2J877Y	The food is great... but don't buy it here!	"My son loves Sprout Organics baby food... especially the Roasted Pear.  As it can be hard to find in stock at local stores I have tried (5 times) to order Sprout Organics from Amazon.  Unfortunately, the twelve packs come in a manufaturer's point of purchase box that only has the name of the baby food on a label and 3 of the 5 boxes I have ordered have contained expired food! And lets be real - you are not going to feed a baby expired food.<br /><br />It is very frustrating and I cannot really blame Amazon because as far as I can tell you have to open the manufacturer's box to get to the expiration information.  So - the food is great but buyer beware.  Check the expiration date because more than half of my orders have arrived to me already expired.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have never updated a review but I feel compelled to do so now.  I contacted Sprout and let them know about the expired food.  The customer service rep who I spoke with told me that I ""wasn't the first person to call them about this problem"" but they seemed to listen to the feedback and even promised to replace the food.  Unfortunately they forgot to send the replacement food so I am now 3 weeks from the date it was received in the mail... no money back... no food.<br /><br />Here is hoping next week brings me better luck."	9	0

1	B002IEVJRY	APDPA11IZPYLN	"illy Brand's New ""issimo"" Coffee Drink - Cappuccino In A Can"	"I have tried different illy brand products and have always enjoyed their products.  The new illy brand ""issimo"" which translates loosely to ""extremely"" or ""remarkably"" pretty much lives up to it's moniker.  At 8.45 oz. and 100 calories, it is a nice pick me up in the AM.  I only enjoy cold coffee products in the summertime when it's hot so I wouldn't be a year round drinker of issimo but I liked the flavor and especially the sweetness of the product.  It isn't sugary sweet, thick and doesn't have an overly ""dairy"" quality to it which I found nice.  Issimo is a light product that doesn't leave you feeling bloated or heavy.  At just under $2.00 a can, it's not the cheapest coffee beverage out there but it's certainly more cost effective than your local, upscale coffee shop."	0	0
1	B0081XPTBS	AMNPBJZDDRLEB	Great product	My daughter has been on this formula since she was born. She has had no issues with it whatsoever and lights up every time she sees the bottle.

1	B001EO5M8G	ADUPZFIJT04ZP	Definitely not like the ones with sugar but great for what they are	Ok, these cookies are definitely not like the meringues with sugar, I agree those taste a million times better. However, when you want to snack and feel like eating a lot, these are great. 1 serving is only 40 calories, 3 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein. They are very chocolatey. You can eat the entire package for 80 calories and still get some protein and fiber. They do stick to your teeth, that's for sure. So, if you are really trying to limit your calories, these are good. However, if you care less about the calories and rather eat fewer cookies, go for the ones with sugar (they are delicious). I'm trying to eat less sugar and find meringues addictive so I'm happy with these.	1	0
-1	B001SB3X86	A3DADP1572NER3	Mushy	These tomatoes are mushy with a dollop of sauce on the top.  They're sweet with a modicum of tomato flavor-not at all what I expected.

-1	B0014EQHUS	AG8MNSC4D95BE	broken boxes and reaction to broth afterward	I have used Swanson's canned broths for over 40 years!! I've complained before about receiving Swanson's Natural Goodness beef and chicken broth from Amazon in damaged boxes and emptying & tossing all boxes in the shipment.  What I did not mention was the lingering and terribly unpleasant odor when emptying and washing the boxes.<br />Tonight I opened a can of chicken broth, first time to use broth since receiving the bad shipments and for the first time ever when cooking with the broth was appalled at the smell..  sorta nauseating.

Possibly the best in this style I've every had.<br /><br />Just the right amount of cocoa powder dusting (which can be somewhat bitter if there's too much). The chocolate truffle center is delicious.<br /><br />These are INSANELY GOOD at this price.<br /><br />Order them, then consume them with a glass of good red wine (my favorite), or by themselves. You can't eat just one.<br /><br />Really, they're THAT GOOD.	1	0
1	B0030FQ9NY	A7C7QG6O3ZHXD	Dog LOVES the Rabbit and Lamb!!!	Maybe it's cause the food from NewZealand, but my Shihtzu loves this stuff.

1	B0062A87HA	ABJM55JKWIKVM	LOVE this stuff!	I had been hunting for canned pumpkin for several weeks (with no luck in my local grocery stores) before remembering last year's pumpkin crop disaster, so out of desperation, I turned to the 'Net and ordered a case of the Farmer's Market product.<br /><br />I'm glad I did--this stuff is great! I originally wanted it for holiday pies, but have already used it for pumpkin pancakes and waffles with superb results, and have lots of other recipes still to try (but expect to have equally good results).<br /><br />It's not been watery in the can, and not a single can arrived with a dent, so I think this was an excellent purchase!

-1	B002GWMD2I	A30R01ROBXJXVE	Weak, Arid and Acidic	Got sucked in by the reviews and promise of no shipping costs.  This stuff isn't even as good as Chock full 'o Nuts Regular out of a can.  Coarse ground and made with normal measurement (5.75 Tbsp to 48 oz. of water in my French press) produced a very weak cup that had no personality or body outside of moderate acidic tang.  Ugh.  By increasing to 6.25 Tbsp, got some body, but the flavor got very dry and arid, and any interesting notes or after taste were still woefully lacking - but I did develop a bit of headache - so I guess it wasn't a total loss.  Don't be fooled, support your favorite local or distant micro producer.	0	1

However, when I received the product and tried it, I was gravely disappointed. It tastes artificial with lots of aftertaste. In my opinion, it does not in anyway taste like sugar. I did appreciate the small packet to try it before I wasted all that tequila in the powder and water as instructed. I thought there was such high shipping cost because it was a liquid and then what a surprise when I got it that it is a powder in an empty bottle. I would never have ordered it if I knew that upfront. I really want to return it but because it was such a large cost for shipping and then I have to pay the shipping back, it would really not be worth it so I'll just suck it up and throw it away!!!	0	0

1	B004BRYVJY	A3T0OTH5072YRE	Snikiddy Southwest Cheddar Cheese Fries	This review is for the Southwest Cheddar cheese fries by Snikiddy.  I've tried the regular Cheddar cheese ones as well, but that's a separate review.  I do have to say, the Southwest is much better than the regular flavor.<br /><br />Snikiddy is an all natural brand.  They use better, pronounceable ingredients.  Although there still is corn content.  They claim they are gluten free, vegetarian, no msg and even kosher.  This particular flavor has ramped up spices in its flavoring mix.  It even has white pepper, which is unusual for a snack food.  But good!  There's jalapeno powder too.  So you can definitely tell they took the Southwest aspect of this snack seriously.<br /><br />I really liked the taste of this snack. Unlike the regular cheddar, it had a tastier cheese flavor.  But wow, was it ever spicy.  My nose started running while I ate it because it was so spicy.  But even with the spicy, you could still taste the cheese.  The texture was still a little chewy while eating after the initial crunchiness, but with a better flavor it wasn't as bad.  The spiciness is a little much at times, but definitely worth it for the flavor.<br /><br />I really did enjoy this particular flavor of Snikiddy fries.  And considering there are limited flavors of Snikiddy snacks in my area I'm glad I liked at least one of the flavors.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012	0	0
1	B000E1BKRC	A2IJ936RKVC512	Oven Fry	I have a weakness for good fried fish and as I age, I've cut down on my fried foods.  No, this is not as good as deep fried fish but it is a darn good substitute.  I cut the fish in small pieces dip them in egg and bread them with Oven Fry.  I cover my cookie sheet with foil, so there are no dishes to wash.  I also put oven fried potatoes in at about the same time.  Then I make a salad to compromise toward a more healthy meal.  It's quick, easy and fairly healthy.  No it's not diet food but it doesn't taste like diet food either.  I just bought a case of Oven Fry from Amazon and am a repeat customer. It has become more and more difficult to find their fish product in supermarkets.  Thank goodness for Amazon when these supermarkets quit carrying the products I enjoy.	1	0
1	B005BPVA3A	A1C139F5C7Y38P	If there were laws against tasty snacks, this one broke them all...	Here's my thoughts on these tasty granola clusters:<br /><br />LOOKS: When opening the bag, I didn't have to work very long to find large clusters, they were sitting on top. Each piece was coated in cocoa, and the oats and almonds were waiting below the surface.<br /><br />PACKAGING: I was pleased to see these bags were resealable. Easy to open, easy to seal, no fussin', no mussin'.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE: Each pouch has roughly 10 servings each. Keep in mind, it's easy to keep on snacking, so pour yourself a handful and leave the bag on the counter if you're trying to make the bag last more than 2 hours...<br /><br />TASTE: The cocoa flavoring really popped out, it's the first smell that hit me when I opened the bag. The next taste was an even mixture between the oats and almonds. I barely tasted the cinnamon at all, but that's just me.<br />Simply put - I LOVED this dry granola snack. One of my coworkers said she would prefer these over Girl Scout Samoa cookies, that's a pretty bold statement!<br /><br />CONCLUSION?<br /><br />If you're looking for something to snack on while you watch Mad Men or plow through another dungeon in Skyrim, this is an excellent choice. Keep a glass of milk nearby!	0	0

With 50 calories and 11gr sugar, I only use one tbsp a day in my green tea daily as well as when I am in need of fast energy, without any additives, right exactly before any sports like weight lifting, mountain biking, surfing, etc. if I have no access to banana or grapefruit. Potassium stops cramps and this is my life saver.. This is a necessity just like I consume honey, Bragg's apple cider, organic flax-sesame seeds, etc. as super food. Once opened, I place some in a smaller tightly sealed container and keep it in refrigerator, refill as needed, but consume it within 6 months. I am into sports, diet and nutrition and blackstrap molasses' nutritional value varies depending on the quality of the sugar cane or beets from which it was extracted. For that reason organic and brand is extremely important to me. Honey looses its medicinal value when added to tea but since molasses is a by product which was heated during the production, further heat does not impact the nutritional value. With all that said, you will still need to get used to the taste since the taste is somewhere around bitter, beet juice and changes the taste of the tea. Bravo.	1	0

-1	B0036B8B0Q	A331T5SMFXI2CY	Okay	I used to get these at Sams Club every now and then, but got tired of them after a bit. They are quite tangy and very chewy. I tried sharing with my seven and eight year old nieces, but only one would eat them. She thought they were okay, but her sister took a bite and decided she hated them. I would recommend buying a few different flavors as singles if you can find them locally. It's a bit too expensive to buy them that way all the time, but you should try the different flavors before you commit to buying them here. Some people love them, others hate them.	0	0

However, my vet said my cats had some tartar and sore gums.  I started mixing this stuff in with their regular food, and now (2 years later) my oldest is 4 with healthy teeth and gums.  I saw improvement in just a month or so.  Now looking at several annual visits in a row with good dental health and no tooth brushing.  Kitties seem to like it.  Healthy weight cats with dry food to graze on all they want.  I order from petfooddirect though.  When you consider the shipping costs, it's usually a little cheaper there unless amazon has it for free shipping.	3	0

This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I think that these Glutino GF pretzels taste better than most ""regular"" pretzels. Less salty than most non GF pretzels too which I think helps bring out their better flavor.<br /><br />These tend to be a little messy - the sesame seeds fall off quite a bit - not so much they aren't on the pretzel but enough that a couple of teaspoons wind up in the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The only quibble is cost; these are usually more expensive than another equally good choice of GF pretzel that I enjoy - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047IG6OU"">Snyder's of Hanover Gluten Free All Natural Pretzel Sticks 8-oz, 12 pack</a>.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended."	0	0

I thought they were... eh... not great (2-3 stars at best), but at least better than nothing when I'm craving cheese and crackers or want crackers in my soup. When I saw the ""whole grain"" version in a store last week, I picked up a box assuming I'd like these better. They are AWFUL!!! I don't know if I got a bad batch, but each bite has a horrible burnt aftertaste. They taste so burned, I'm looking closely at them to see if they are black on one side or something (they aren't). Is it the black speckly ""multi-grain"" inside? Maybe they burned the tiny seeds/grains and cooked them in anyway? Again, maybe I just got a funky batch, but I'm not buying these again."	0	0

1	B000GAO91K	AZ9B75YQ1DTCB	Wonderful	"Just make sure you keep this refrigerated so it doesn't spoil, and it has a low burn temperature so it's not recommended for cooking. I love this for vinegar and oil dressing, pasta, and putting it in shakes for my kids (they get the omega 3 and omega 6 benefits without knowing it). There really is no flavor to it so you can put it on a numerous amount of cold foods or already prepared cooked foods. I also got sunburned on my shoulders and back so my husband rubbed some of this on and it really helped relieve the burn and I barely peeled. It soaked in my skin well and wasn't very ""oily"" at all. The hemp oil I got came with 2 bottles so I gave one to my mother-in-law and she loves it also and asked me to order more.

-1	B002TMV3GC	A1BXVZSQOJE6UE	Only Ok	Not much to say about the Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee.  The coffee itself was decent enough, although I thought the hazlenut flavor was a tad strong.  It wasn't the best coffee I've ever had but was decent enough for an everyday brew.

-1	B001EPPBTK	A2CI9YEK8TN7Y1	Not Exactly Stupendous	For me, this is nothing more than weak hot chocolate that tastes as if a cinnamon hot drop hard candy was ground up and dropped into it. I had really been looking for ward to this, but to my palette generic store brand cocoa is more appealing. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to adequately mix with milk. Always a grainy, chunky bottom layer persisted towards the last ounce and it surely did not enhance the flavor.<br /><br />Sorry Nestle, but this product is definitely not for me.	1	0

-1	B004JRSAJS	A3DMIJGJV4FXTY	They made me sick!	These literally made me sick.  First, when you open the package you have to drain off the water, which is fine except that once you do the whole thing has the faint scent of fish.  I guess that's not so bad if you like fish, but I don't. (2) Then you have to put them in a pan full of water and boil them for about 1 minute.  What you come up with are these small little pearls that essentially smell fishy and taste like nothing at all unless maybe its pearls of tasteless rubber.  I tried butter and salt, the flavoring from ramen noodles, spaghetti sauce, velveeta for mac and cheese.  Nothing made the consistency of these little pearls any better.  In essence it feels like you are taking a mouthful of big metamucil (which makes me gag anyway).  But beyond that, after I ate the smallest amount of them, they made my stomach cramp and I was nauseated for the rest of the evening.  At first I thought it was just a quirky thing, but I tried something else on them to see if it made them better and I got even sicker.  At that point I was done.  Yeuck.  A waste of money.  I'm going to try the kind mixed with tofu and if they stink as bad as these, or make me sick then I'm done, if I don't end up in the hospital with some gastric illness.	4	3
1	B003CK2BQG	A4TAYDT1ZW49D	Very good for what it is	"We've been ""product testing"" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama ""Sushi Bar"" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea ""taste"" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. ""Sushi Bar""-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff."	3	0
1	B001ONRO2O	AWBA6E5E1FIR8	Easily my favorite snack cracker. Mmm Pepper-Jack!	These crackers have tons of flavor and just enough kick. They are very crispy which is nice. What I really like about these is that the flavor is in the cracker itself, not a powder they coat the crackers with (like many other flavors). I can't stand the flavor powder, it gets all over your hands and makes the crackers less crispy. These are crispy and not greasy. They really are a great snack (& highly addictive, I can down a box VERY FAST) and the real cheese flavor is very apparent. Highly recommended... I only wish I could buy these in bulk via Amazon Prime... Till then, Wally*World will be my place to buy.	0	0
-1	B000UI39YG	A28IB49Z4F36Z3	Torani vs Da Vinci	I read reviews preferring Da Vinci, so I gave it a try.  I prefer Torani.  Torani has fuller, truer flavor.  Da Vinci was very thin and had minimally higher sodium.  Can't really justify the price for Da Vinci.  Torani was strong enough to provide flavor and go a long way before needing to be restocked.  I am sorry I bought three bottles of Da Vinci.  But I am certain now, after my taste testing, that no matter what the flavor, Torani has a satisfactory rating with me, and Da Vinci has an unsatisfactory rating.	1	1

1	B003NCECVA	AIUV1L8QSRS18	The BEST!	We are on a NO MONSANTO diet, so we seek out organic grains that are not grown with Monsanto's Frankinseeds. Plus we seek organic whenever possible because we believe they are healthier and we know they taste better. This popcorn is wonderful. It pops up light and flavorful with a deep old fashioned popcorn taste that modern popcorn can't touch. After eating Amish popcorn for so long, I began to doubt my tastebuds. Is it really that good? I thought. So I tried some Orville R. I popped in my regular way and I tried some microwave. Both tasted like salty styrofoam compared. There IS a difference.<br /><br />Tips:<br /> We don't like air popcorn so I use a round, domed popcorn maker, I think Amazon sells it. Use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. It is outstanding, and tastes like movie popcorn did a long time ago. I was told that before coconut oil became a health food fad, it was dirt cheap and that movies used it to pop their popcorn (when they used to have giant popcorn machines in the theater). I also use butter sometimes. Yeah, it's me and Julia Child against the world.<br /><br />For another really good taste, sprinkle on Spike instead of salt. It's amazing.<br /><br />Use popcorn salt instead of regular. It is finer and sticks to the popcorn better. I take Kosher salt and put it into a coffee grinder (not used for coffee) to make popcorn salt, but you can buy it, maybe from Amazon. I haven't checked.<br /><br />Keep the popcorn you are not going to use within a couple of months, in the freezer so they don't dry out. Dried out kernels don't pop very well.	2	1
1	B004772OWE	A17SI29DNSK3HQ	Great aroma, Great taste!	The India Spice Chai is a great tea.  I've tried a lot of different brands of Chai and hadn't found any until this one that compared to the kind I made with the actual spices in a pan.

So if your child has these issues, I would recommend ordering the oatmeal. We have been missing a little bit of pureed prune to overcome the constipation and it works like a charm! We will now buy one can of the oatmeal to try and if she likes it, will order another case!	1	0

-1	B006YZK758	A2TJG4N8LNJW23	Mediocre is the only appropriate word...	One of the really big selling points of the Keurig brewer was that it produced hot beverages other than just coffee. Teas, cappuccinos and hot chocolates were all available and we were eager to try them. I did my research after we got our brewer for Christmas, though, and was really disappointed to read a pile of negative reviews for pretty much every hot chocolate brand available.<br /><br />The Swiss Miss hot chocolate was on sale at our local grocery store so we decided we had to try it. It had ranked a little bit higher than most of the other brands so I held out hope that it would work out. I brewed a small cup when we got home and gave it a shot. The consistency that came out of the machine was nice and the consistency didn't seem watery.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like the no calorie Swiss Miss hot chocolate available in sleeves. While you're drinking it, it tastes alright, but then it's followed by a very plasticy synthetic aftertaste. There's no mistaking the artificial sweetener here and I can see how that would bother a lot of people, especially those with sensitive taste buds.<br /><br />I think we'll finish the rest of the box, but I'm not convinced we'll repurchase. We'll probably just use the Keurig to prepare the water and then use traditional hot chocolate packets.	0	0

I use the veal stock, the chicken stock, and the demi glace religiously, and it is so easy to make great sauces with them.  I add a spoonful of stock or demi glace even to things which don't normally call for them such as marinara, soups, turkey stuffing, which gives the foods an extra degree of richness.<br /><br />If you try this product line, you will be more than pleased with the result."	0	0

-1	B001SAXPEO	A3UFRBCC1CSCSJ	The bags were damaged with holes and stains.	The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette.	7	2

1	B0000DJ7YW	AA47JSI7DSV42	Deeeelicious!	Omaha Steaks mean quality and these fit the reputation. There are four different stuffed breasts which is a problem when you have more than one eating! Sharing is recommended as long as you receive an equal amount in return. All four are excellent. These are made from honest-to-goodness chicken breast meat and not the kind that are shaped and formed by processing lots of chicken meat(and filler or edible adhesive stuff) into a chicken tunnel filled with some filling. If you want a real treat, try these. (Consider how many you are feeding, and buy accordingly!)	3	0
-1	B0085MLY5A	A2UO944UHQVLRW	Worst packaging and drink ever!	I was hesitant of buying this product since there were so many mixed reviews. I decided to try it since I enjoy coconut water. I have been to the Caribbean and enjoyed water coconuts and fresh exotic fruits, so I thought I would love this. I was excited when this arrived. I opened it up and the smell threw me back. When I twisted the cap, the pouring spout ripped away from the carton, which made the ease of storing much more difficult. I tried a sip and it was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. It tasted bitter and it smelled like burnt rubber. I have tried several of the exotic fruits listed in the ingredients, but this drink tasted nothing like them. I tried chilling it to see if it made the taste better and there was no improvement. If you are expecting this to taste like real coconut water, you will surely be disappointed.

1	B001397WV2	AFS8GLUYZIE58	great high quality food	Pros: organic, grain free and a reputable company that gives back to the community<br />cons: my cats needed a few days to get used to this. yes the meat looks grey. but that is because it is all natural.<br />What I do is mix a 3 ounce can with half a can of Wellnes Beef and Chicken. (so its 3/4 meat and only 1/4 chicken) This seems to work. They love this combo. If I just give them the newman's, they eat but don't finish it. Out of all of the grain free beef canned cat foods, I've had the most success with this. My cats didn't like Nature's Variety Instinct or by nature organic. (Both great brands) But its really important to rotate protein sources so that my cats don't develop allergies (my six year old cat recently developed a seafood allergy after only eating seafood for 5 years...) so I push the beef on them.<br />Give it a shot. It might take some work or creativity but eventually you should win. Both my cats are v finicky and I found a way to make it work. Organic beef! I don't even eat organic beef all the time! LOL! ITs a bit pricey but its worth it. Healthy food = healthy cats=longer life=less disease/health problems.	2	0

Both boxes were marked ""received in damaged condition"" - from the shipper.  I've never received any other damaged products from Amazon, so I made the mistake of ordering the chips again, thinking it was a fluke. Evidently not. Will not buy these from Amazon again."	0	0
-1	B000E46GGO	A3QBKYANO0T7O0	Lots of Sugar!	"I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like ""Pop Tarts"" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item."	3	3
-1	B001TZPY0Q	A29SRKOBMFTKUS	No flavor	In trying several different brands of mascarpone, I found this to be the least pleasing. Stiff texture. Not much flavor at all, not very sweet, and almost a bitter taste - I didn't even finish the tub. Vermont Cheese and Trader Joe's are the best I've found so far, although they have distinctively different flavors.	1	0

1	B001ELJK46	A1M09YQVFJ7GGU	Wins in blind taste test	I made this wine and it had been in the bottle about 2 1/2 months. I bought a 16$ bottle of Verdicchio at a local store and took it to a party. We did a blind taste test with a group very familiar with Italian wines and my wine won hands down. In fact the owner of Bar Italia in St. Louis was very impressed.<br /><br />A couple of notes on the wine making. I did add water to 6 gals but when I racked the wine after primary fermentation I racked into a 5 gal carboy and did not add water. I have another kit of this variety and this time I will add some yeast nutrient and ferment at a lower temp. Last time my primary fermentation was finished in 4 days.	3	0

-1	B005VOOM4A	AG90OGHDGOOVH	Ho, Hum	Conveniently single cup packaging, perfect for traveling, smells great when you unseal the foil packet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about it for the positives. The down side is that the packaging is appropriate for 'pod' brewing only and ends up brewing a pretty weak cup of coffee at that (maybe I'm biased, since I tend to brew Gevalia Dark Roast at about 7-8 scoops per 12 cup pot). I think that, at best, this is an average cup of coffee. P-)	2	2

-1	B006Q820X0	#oc-R2GDRKIV15IZHW	Doesn't Work Well in Keurig Brewer	While the flavor of this coffee is acceptable, mechanically it just does not work in the Keurig brewer.  I don't know if the problem is the size of the grind or some problem with the K-cup containers themselves, but almost every cup I have tried to make has been virtually unuseable.<br /><br />The water barely drips from the K-cup while brewing instead of producing a steady stream as other containers do. On at least two occasions the back-pressure was so high as to cause my brewer to overflow out of the top of the K-cup container because the brew could not be pushed through the K-cup as it should be.  Both holes were punched in the K-cup correctly and the holes in the needles are NOT obstructed.  I can remove the Brooklyn K-cup and insert any other one I have and it will flow correctly.  I have two brewers and the problem is the same in both brewers.<br /><br />In addition to the over-flow and back-pressure problems, every cup I have brewed has also contained a significant portion of coffee grounds in the cup, several cups have been so full of grounds as to be undrinkable.  This leads me to believe that at least part of the problem is the size of the grind.<br /><br />I've used almost half the box trying to get things to work to no avail, but I don't feel I can request a refund after using that much of the product.  I have no interest in replacement product as the flavor is not that special and I don't trust it to work any better.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience recommend this coffee to anyone.	7	6
-1	B004HYH8PU	AZFOZTEJAI5J5	Cats are obligate carnivores	Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.	3	0

1	B0046HJXUG	A2KX7KUKTPG4H9	I'd eat these even if I could eat gluten	My husband is the one with Celiacs.

The [all-important] texture is good, the flavor is nice and even a bit more interesting than regular pasta. I highly recommend them.<br /><br />My only caveat is to always use ample [2 tbsp] oil [olive, flavored oil, whatever your preference] when boiling your pasta, and stir them quickly after add them to the water as they all want to stick to the bottom of the pot as soon as they get the chance. And of course, don't over cook... non-gluten and mushy are a natural pair and you want to discourage that when at all possible!	2	0
1	B001TLY7A8	A34D626U4JYK99	The BEST food my cat has ever eaten	I cannot stress enough what a picky eater my cat is. Just to get her to eat more than a quarter of a 5.5 oz can of food at a time is quite the ordeal. For some time, I had to mix Nutri-cal with her food, because she is tiny for her age and isn't gaining weight at the rate she should be (she is a kitten). I was just about to settle with Earthborn Holistic canned chicken, as she seemed to like it more than any other food I had tried feeding her. It also appeared and smelled far less disgusting to me than the mush that comes in most cans; the consistency of the Earthborn is chicken shreds in gravy, which my cat seems to prefer. But as I was browsing in the cat food section today, I noticed Weruva Paw-lickin Chicken and picked it up to try because according to the description, it seemed that it would have the same consistency as Earthborn. It's also Grain-free and has no veggies (only this flavor is veggie free though) like Earthborn. And it costs the same, so I figured it wouldn't be difficult financially to switch over to Weruva, if she happens to like it.<br /><br />When I opened the can of Weruva today, I immediately noticed that the quality of this food is even better than Earthborn. The formula is almost soupy, with thinner shreds, which are easier for my kitten to chew and swallow. The smell is VERY tolerable and it actually looks like food a human would eat. The BEST part however is that she ate almost ALL of the 3 oz can. I was so shocked to see that once she was done eating what I spooned into her bowl, she went over the open can and began eating.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned initially when I noticed that even though the food is not described as adult food, in the back in small print it says it is for adult nutrition. However, according to Weruva's website, it is fine to feed it to kittens. The only difference between adult food and kitten food apparently, is that kitten food is supposed to contain more protein, because they need more for their growing bodies. But if fed a sufficient amount, this food, especially because it is very protein rich to begin with, provides complete nutrition for kittens as well. Seeing how much she ate confirms that.<br /><br />My only concern with this food, which is any person's concern with any premium quality food is the price. These foods ARE pricey and it can be difficult to justify spending so much on cat food, but if you can afford it, the benefits of premium quality foods (those that are byproduct and grain free, and preferably veggie free) are:<br /><br />-Their poop becomes significantly less stinky. The difference is very noticeable.<br />-The food itself doesn't smell so bad. And this really depends on what type of meat and consistency you buy as well. If you buy a chicken or turkey flavor food, it will be less smelly than a fish food. I don't see the point in feeding your cat fish other than as an occassional treat if she likes it, because it contains some levels of mercury and is not as nutritious to begin with. I've noticed that the mushy formula food smells considerably worse than the gravy foods. Also, I understand that cat foods are smelly because cats will only eat food that has a very strong smell, but that being said, there's a difference between a stench that permeates your room and a smell that remains concentrated in the general area where the food itself is.<br />-You end up saving money on vet bills, because these foods provide superior nutrition and a healthy animal is less likely to be a sickly animal.	5	0

1	B0017TNMVM	A3KVLRBSMLCJAL	Best made duck chips in USA	One, which I believe is the best part, is that this product is produced in the US, not in another country.

She will grudgingly eat it if she's really hungry, but half the time there are still bits left in her dish the next day, albeit licked quite clean of any trace of sauce. (she LOVES sauce - if they ever make a canned catfood that's all sauce, she'll be in heaven)<br /><br />Even our big orange tabby, who's a former street cat and will eat just about anything, (I've seen him eat cooked carrots) doesn't care much for it.<br /><br />If your cats like pate-style food and don't go for the bits and shreds and other flaked-and-form styles, they probably won't like this one either.

-1	B002HQR4LS	AVCV97AITKDG4	Sounded Good at the Time but.....	My first objection to the mix was the difficulty of preparation. I buy mixes for ease expecting to add water or milk and maybe an egg, not all three plus melted butter. That being said, I mixed all expecting something wonderful. The batter smelled like soapy dish water to the point of making me feel ill. I sampled the batter and found it to be a strong smelling buttermilk batter with some occasional ( far too few) spirgs of coconut floating around. I prepared the batter and was sorely disappointed in the waffle. The next time I doctored the batter with sugar and vanilla but was still disappointed in the final product.<br />  If this were an actual store -- I would return it but returns are too much trouble over the internet assuming they take it back.I would be willing to try another of thier products if they would swap out the coconut but I'm not holding my breath that they will offer.<br />  My verdict --Save your money, its buttermilk batter mix with too acid a bite to the buttermilk and a foul smell.	0	0

1	B004QS2RRG	A34HIENNTM60TS	Great tasting sausage	I just tried this manufacturer's sausage for the first time and must say  the quality, flavor, and easy open packs of this pork/beef sausage are excellent. The flavor is not overpowering but the taste of caraway really gives it a nice flavor boost. The outer casing is soft and not chewy or tough like so many sausage casings. In Wisconsin landjaeger is available for purchase in the southwest part of the state where there is a large community of Swiss/American residents who make this great sausage as part of their Swiss heritage. The sausage is a common meat product in Switzerland. But for those who love a good meat product in easy open packets who do not want to travel to Wisconsin or Switzerland, I would highly recommend this product for consumption. Great for lunch or just as a snack when you want something hearty with 0 grams of sugar and carbs.	0	0

1	B000GJQ5C2	A1EUWASS6WER2B	Great Cake	I was a little concerned about ordering food items from online but this was the perfect choice.  My husband loves Rum and Tortuga Rum Cake but it is hard to find in local stores or it's to pricey for me.  I had received a gift card for Amazon and thought I would give you guys a try.  To my surprise it was fast, easy and worth it.  I will have more orders.  This cake is absolutely wonderful.  My husband prefers it in thin slices with a little butter on top and heated in the microwave, just until a little warm.  He also likes to add a little extra Rum.  The cake was very fresh.  If you like a soft and moist cake not sort of dry and spongy this is the cake for you.  They have lots of different flavors as well.  Hope this helps someone.	4	0

-1	B0013NUGDE	A24ZV048V7J0MT	So So	I have to agree with the recent reviews, these are just so so as far as taste.  I bought them as a lightning deal special thinking these would be a little healthier and keep me away from the Kettle chips that I love...after eating a bag of these, I want the Kettle chips back.  They are ok but not as good as a fried chip.  Maybe eating these will discourage me from chips period.  Like some other people making comments, I'll probably finish the box and not buy again.  They remind me of Pringle chips just smaller and maybe a little puffier.	0	0

1	B001T4UMM2	A1BVVO5IQ4FTV2	A new combination buy suggestion.	My 35 lbs. terrier has been devoted to Checkups Dental Dog Treats for several years but he is nuts for the combination of 1/2 a Checkup stuffed into a medium-sized Kong ribbed Stuff-a-Ball. After about two years, he is on his fourth Kong, having worn and weakened the others after many hours of torturing it. Pushing it all the way into the new Kong might take hand strength and determination on your part. Getting it out requires crushing doggie jaw pressure, a series of well-thought out strategies like slamming down the Kong while perched on a footstool, or carrying it up a flight of steps and bouncing it down to the lower level, then checking each step for crumbles that may have dislodged on the trip down. All the time he is working on extracting the dental bone, he is cleaning his teeth on the Kong - I don't think the vet will ever have to have to anesthetize him and clean them again. My boy brings me the Kong right after he finishes his supper each night and cries like a girl until I stuff it with a Checkup and the fun can begin.	1	0
1	B003QNJYXM	A1L6A80L3YDNN4	Great Deal on Great Product	This is the 3rd time ordering 5-Hour Energy through Amazon.  I use this almost every day, probably a bit too much but is great for a boost of energy at work and doesn't give me the jitters.  Buying bulk like this makes it just under $2/bottle as long as you get free shipping which ALL STAR HEALTH offers and the order doesn't have to be $25 or more either! JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T USE THE DEFAULT SELLER FOR THIS ITEM.  EVERY TIME I FORGET TO ORDER THIS THROUGH ALL STAR HEALTH IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG TO RECEIVE.  ALL STAR HEALTH WILL PROCESS AND SHIP THE VERY NEXT DAY USING UPS AND THE DEFAULT (AMAZON) TAKES 3 DAYS TO PROCESS, THEN SHIPS VIA USPS (SNAIL MAIL).  USING ALL STAR HEALTH I HAVE ORDERED ON A SUNDAY AND ACTUALLY RECEIVED ON A TUESDAY WITH STANDARD (FREE) SHIPPING.	2	0
1	B003VTG7RC	A12R3YGEHW7D8G	Excellent Tonic!	This tonic is really really good. Way better than the Canada Dry or other items you get in the grocery store. It is low calorie, and compliments your gin or vodka instead of overpowering the flavor. Really high quality stuff that I highly recommend or the best mixed drink. Try it out in a four pack to see if you like it and then go for the 24 pack as it is a great value. Worth the expense. Enjoy!	5	0

-1	B0055QB7XI	AYX7ZUAWF8LFV	EWWWWWWWW!!!!	Worst pasta sauce....IN THE WORLD!!!!  So horrible!!!  It tastes like someone dumped a bag of sugar in it!  I would rather have ketchup on top of my pasta!  (In fact, this sauce reminds me of Hunt's ketchup - - way too sugary.  If you prefer Hunt's over Heinz, then maybe you will like this pasta sauce)  It sounds like I'm exaggerating and I am, but not by much.  You should totally stick to Prego or if you're feeling fancy try Antonello's Salsa di Pomodoro.	0	0

1	B0049RDI0Y	A2HN943685953U	Delicious, Fresh...perfect!	I just tried a can of this C2O coconut water for the first time today and LOVE the flavor!  I bought it at the local chain natural market, despite being hesitant because other brands of coconut water have tasted weird and not much like the water from a fresh coconut at all.  Well, I liked it so much that I wanted to see if I could find it online.  I found it here, but it's too pricey.  At the market, I paid $1.79 + 10 cents CRV, so $1.89 for one can.  So I was sure I'd find it for a better deal here...not the case.  The sale price is $29 for a case of 12.  That's $2.42 per can.  Disappointing...Amazon is almost always the best deal or at least super close.  If Amazon can do better than $1.89 per can, I will definitely order because this C2O coconut water is awesome!!!	49	6

1	B000I5IS2E	A1HUWMVOU4PRH2	Love this cocoa, not the price	I only use Saco cocoa because it's amazing, but I don't know what going on with the price. It's almost doubled over the past 3 years or so on Amazon. Wish I still lived in New York where, as of now, I'm betting it's cheaper to buy in store (Yonkers Super Stop And Shop carried it). Unfortunately, my local stores here in northern California dont carry it.  Bummer.	0	0
1	B000ZT12NK	AOVROBZ8BNTP7	Better and cheaper than the competition	Got this for my kids.  Halfway through his first box my five year old announced it was better than the stuff with the cows on it.  I agree, it is better.  On top of that, the package contains more cartons than than the organic product for less money.  Of course it's from cows not treated with rbST.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Reduced fat milk, sugar, contains 1% or less of each of the following: cocoa (processed with alkali), cocoa, carrageenan, salt, artificial flavor, vitamin A palmitate and vitamin D3.<br /><br />Chocolate milk is the only dairy product that I think tastes good with carrageenan in it.  Most chocolate milks have it.  It's made from seaweed, has been a food product for centuries, and adds a nice creaminess to the drink.<br /><br />In short, great product, great price, and great for the kids (especially when traveling.)	6	0
1	B0012271T8	A1GR7MR1246P4Q	Best cocoa ever!	No offense to the Swiss Miss, but this is the best cocoa ever. It's rich, chocolatey and so creamy, you'd think it was mixed with milk. If you've ever been to Waffle House and had an awesome cup of cocoa, you can bet it was Butternut. I see it's out of stock right now, but you can get it at Randall's grocery store and online through places that provide beverages to businesses (coffee icon, coffee wholesale USA, etc).	2	0
1	B0027YUN1S	A3OD6CUUOOO6BI	Wholesome Product, Convenient, Good Taste, OK Price.	I am for the most part a health nut.  I am always looking for very healthy food, that is also convenient.  Taste unfortunately has to take a lower priority, and I generally expect to pay more ('you get what you pay for' even applies to food and health; low quality food = low quality health).  I consider this product to satisfy all overall fairly well.  The taste is good considering it is raw and wholesome, however, taste is subjective, you may not agree.  It can be a bit hard, so when I can, I put it in a bowl and soak it in a little water for a few minutes and eat it like cereal.  I think it takes better that way too.<br />Lastly, we'd all like everything cheaper including this product, but I at least like the extra discount I get from the subscribe and save.  It makes a difference.	1	0
1	B000H0ZJNG	A37U44QN3A3DJN	Tasty dog treat made in the USA	Our Bichon likes all the Zuke treats we've given him and he's been eating them for a few years.  However, he loves these chicken Z-filets!  We break up the filets since he's a small dog and they're high protein as well.  They're natural and made in the USA.  I've looked through Petsmart several times looking for made in the USA, natural, good-for-dog treats and the selection is very small.  So Zuke's is a great find.	3	0

1	B001EQ5A5E	A3F4OO6AEYUWNG	My favorite since childhood	"YES we will never run out of this again !<br /><br />I cook a lot of shall we say ""robust"" foods at home - from smoking my own BBQ with chili's flown in from New Mexico (the Dixon Hatch, can't be beat) to making my own gumbo.  One of our favorite dishes is blackened salmon - it's healthy, very flavorful and most importantly the kids love it.  Paul Prudhomme's spices have always been my favorite although I have to admit I was raised on them (as now are my kids) so I'm probably biased.  I've tried other seasonings (even by other 'celebrity chefs') and I have found them to be too flavorless, or waaaaay too salty.  Mr. P's is definitely my favorite, and for decades we've been buying the teeny glass bottles in the grocery store.  I go heavy on the spice, and these jars would only last 2 meals and all too frequently the wife would come home with giant filets of salmon from Costco only to find out we're out of seasoning.  We like salmon, but honestly once you have blackened salmon it's as hard to revert back to plain salmon as it is to go from home-smoked brisket back to burgers.  Recently I've made several purchases on Amazon and have been totally impressed, so when I saw they carried these giant jars, at a great price, I immediately purchased them.  Now we'll never run out - I'm stoked !<br /><br />Here's how I use this:<br /><br />- cast iron on medium heat, or in the smoker with coals in the meatbox.  Medium because in the past I've used high as recommended and had too much trouble controlling the cooking (flipping before burning, etc) and generated way too much smoke.  cooking on medium doesn't produce as much of a crust as on high, but the kids like it.  I could potentially smoke it with the blackened seasoning, but I actually prefer to grill it instead to at least get a little bit of a crust, and just to get it going.  salmon doesn't need the tenderizing of a low and slow, and I actually don't want the hickory in this dish.<br /><br />- i don't dredge the salmon in butter.  this is also part of why I don't get the nice crust I should, but again the kids like it.  I just coat the pan or grilles with Pam, place the fillets on a plate, and smother both sides with the spice.<br /><br />- throw it on the heat, and cook normally.<br /><br />Like I said, this won't get you the great crust.  I do get some caramelizing action, but nowhere near as much as if I dredged the fish in butter first and flash fried them.<br /><br />A couple notes on the spice itself:<br /><br />1. This is NOT a hot spice.  It's a very flavorful spice.  If you want to heat it up you can add your own ground pepper to the mix (may I suggest the Dixon Hatch).  However, if British food livens up your taste buds, you may consider this to be hot.<br />2. Like any spice, this will last much longer in much better shape if you store it carefully.  Most people put their spices right by the stove, where they are subjected to heat and humidity.  I'm guilty of this, but I'm aware that both are destroyers of spice.  If you can, keep this spice away from both heat and humidity and seal the cans well.  I'll probably place them in a large zip lock once I crack one open.<br />3. If you're new to spicy foods in general, or to cajun/creole spices I suggest you try a small bottle first and make sure it's for you.<br />4. If you're on a low sodium diet, check the specifications first as Cajun/Creole spice blends tend to have quite a bit of salt in them although the Chef Paul brand has much less (by flavor at least) than many other brands I've tried.<br />5. Don't forget the Blackened Steak Magic !!<br />6. I haven't actually received this spice yet.  Chef Paul is a large, very established brand and I presume consistent quality across their product line, but everything I'm writing is based on my usage of the teeny glass bottles.  I've been purchasing Chef Paul for 20 years now though and have no reason to believe that there would be any difference between this giant spice-head sized container and the teeny containers.<br /><br />If you're into spicier foods, or venturing for the first time into Blackened Redfish, you honestly can't go wrong with this guy.  Try a tiny bottle and find out - then get this can, stock up, and never run out again.  I'm stoked at the possibility of being able to blacken up fish on demand without ever having to make another last-minute run for the seasoning.  Thank you Chef Paul and Amazon !"	0	0

1	B000LR7QMM	A1OL7EP0ELWZXS	Salmon Roe Caviar	Few months ago, I bout salmon roe caviar in three different variety ( American salmon caviar, Canadian salmon caviar, and Russian salmon caviar) for try from GourmetFoodStore . They are delivered via express mail in cold pack. The products are all fresh and good condition. They are all taste as it should be, how ever the American product was better than Canadian product in my taste buds but the Russian product were even better for my taste buds.<br />In view of these, I recommend all of the product equally, but Russian is my choice for my taste buds.

-1	B0041FEARE	A3F0ZYNNJCQ2BP	Nothing special	This coffee is sort of grocery store quality-a whole bean folgers maybe. We like Folgers for a change, but we don't like paying these bigger prices for such small quality. It says it is espresso, but it brews very weak. The flavor is fine, but again, weak. We weren't impressed with how it has turned out. The Three Peckered Goat flavor was great, however.	0	0
1	B00412W76S	ARXU7TM4XXI1D	No more breast milk!	Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.	3	0

1	B000H0ZJHW	AGJ49GGLOM011	Go to treat	This is a household staple for our dear dog who loves the taste. These treats are moist and firm enough for a few chews. They will dry  if left in the open, which is why we have a vacuum sealed container to put them in. The size is perfect-- it really is the size of a pencil eraser. We usually get the salmon because the smell is irresistible to our dog. When I have them around, a whiff and a look from me and our dog is sitting & staying for a treat. We also stuff a kong with it sometimes. We have 2 more bags around just so that we don't run out. We tried the peanut butter, it was great too but we keep coming back to salmon.	0	0
1	B000LQORDE	A3FJ4OB5UC1UFU	SOOO GOOD	My roommate in college used to buy the Nong Shim Shin Cups and I loved them a lot, but didn't want to cook in Styrofoam every day.

1	B004CLCEDE	A36PR697ZIUGX5	"Great ""Pasta"" - I could even sneak it past my husband!"	"I just made my first dish with Miracle Noodles and I love them!  By themselves, they truly taste like nothing.  But, all I did was add a touch of butter, a bit of garlic powder, and few chunks of chicken breast and I had a pasta meal fit for queen!  YUM! I can only imagine the possibilities.<br /><br />I gave some to my hubby to eat, and he wanted more. He loves angel hair pasta and didn't even notice that these were a ""different"" kind of noodle.  It is filling, warm, and takes on the taste of what ever it is served with.  It has that satisfying toothiness of pasta that is cooked just barely beyond al dente.<br /><br />There are NO calories according to the nutritional informational.  So, for me, this is all the taste with none of the guilt.  We can have our pasta and eat it too.... just like that in that Meryl Streep movie, Defending Your Life.<br /><br />Cons:  The fishy smell before it is rinsed and cooked<br />  Preparation is a bit more intensive than regular pasta, but not bad<br />  Small packages (two very small pasta servings per package<br /><br />Pros:  Taste<br />  Texture<br />  no calories<br />  versatile<br />  can easily be passed off as ""normal"" pasta<br />  filling<br /><br />Overall.... this is a BIG FIVE!

The filling is half marshmallow and half chocolate, and when you toast the tarts long enough, the filling becomes all nice and gooey and you can lick it out of the edges. Frosting is also pretty good, but the real treat is the filling and the fact that the crust tastes better than most others.	1	0

Before beginning this new lifestyle my creature comforts were mints & gum, but because almost all of them are made with sugar / sugar alternative that raise insulin, I thought I had to give them up completely. Xylitol doesn't require insulin to metabolize so these mints were a god-sent. I love having multiple packs at once - I keep one in my purse & one at the office. Any time I need a breath freshner, a throat soother or a sweet treat I pop 2-3 in my mouth & I'm good to go! I'm so glad these mints exist.	1	0

1	B001EO6BKO	AY4D3S0E9JFL2	Great product, will buy again	I love this product. It is very handy in the kitchen -- I cook a lot and use orange zest in many recepies. The individual small (one tablespoon) packets inside the box are vacuum sealed and the zest kept its aroma quite well, although it is not the same as fresh. But it is not always possible to have fresh organic oranges at hand, and I would never use zest with chemical pesticides in my cooking. So it is nice to know that I have these packets whenever I need them.	0	0

-1	B002CENRLG	AVTB8XR40I5Q6	AWFUL!!	These are totally disgusting!  This is the second time I have tried them because I really wanted to like them.  I have read so many good reviews and Hungry Girl strongly recommends them.  I am not a picky eater at all, but I just cannot swallow these.  The fishy smell does go away, but the texture makes them inedible.  YUCK.  I have tried both the angel hair and the fettucine.  I was laughing so hard when I read the reviewers remark about her husband spitting them out like on the movie BIG.  I spit them out too.  LOL	3	2
-1	B000I1R0JU	AMOG8TZ3A4PJE	Absorbs, doesn't track but heavy and unpleasant perfume.	In search for a non-tracking highly absorbent kitty litter, I found this Ever Clean product. The reviews sounded good so I ordered three boxes for the three litter pans in the house. The order came quickly with each box of litter in it's own Amazon cardboard box. The FedEx delivery man must have been annoyed at the weight because he left the boxes on the ground outside the deck box I have by the front door specifically put there and noted for package deliveries. It is a good thing it rained prior to the delivery!<br />Anyway back to the litter itself. I have a 16 year-old cat who was diagnosed with diabetes last spring. She is receiving insulin twice a day and is doing well but drinks and pees alot more then she used to. With other litters I have tried, the urine sunk right to the bottom of the pan becoming muddy and difficult to scoop. The Ever Clean litter absorbs and clumps well, but has a heavy coarse sand-like consistency. It also has a heavy (to me) perfume to it that I do not care for. After scooping the pans each night, I can smell the perfume throughout the house and on me. It is better than the odor of cat urine but is a very heavy floral, not a fresh smell at all. I have never liked litter that comes in a box because it seems like you lose a 1/2 cup or more of litter between the walls of the box. At the price of the Ever Clean, every bit counts.<br />I have since discovered Cat's Pride Fresh and Light which I have mixed with the Ever Clean. The Fresh and Light jug is much easier to handle weight-wise, absorbs well, doesn't track and has no odor to it. Eventually the Fresh and Light will be the sole litter I use.	1	0

Amazing flavor - somewhere between velvet (chocolate) and crispy (nuts).  Made me feel almost relaxed... weired...<br />Yesterday, I had it for breakfast, instead of granola, with milk.

1	B000CQ01JW	A2BZCHIDR5FTYA	A little bit different from most.	"Anyone who loves mac-n-cheese has tried some type of brand of shells-n-cheese. The only difference is the shape of the pasta. It became a huge hit with kids because it is so cheesy.<br /><br />Then various companies decided to use real cheese spreads, usually with some sort of plastic or foil pouch encloused. These caught on quickly for good reason. Not only can consumers see that they are getting, in most cases, real cheese, but consumers feel that they are making the dish healther for the family.<br /><br />Whether that is true or not depends mainly on WHICH brand you used. The more expensive the brand does not always mean more healthy. Let us face it, many powders are just as good tasting and as healthy for your family as the squeeze. It was psychological. It worked.<br /><br />Then came microwave mac-n-cheese. This quickly became a busy parent's dream. However, it is not much faster than stove top. (Perhaps 4 minutes.) But when people think of microwaves, they think ""fast"". So this is currently the new craze. Not much faster and still bowls to wash. You usually get LESS pasta this way too, even though you are paying just a little bit more than normal for what you think is convenient.<br /><br />KRAFT advertises more than most brands, so shoppers are more apt to pick up the KRAFT brand. Think about it. How many ads do you recall seeing about ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN? Personally, I do not recall a single one. Therefore, most people totally ignore this brand.<br /><br />Bad move. If you check out the box, this brand is actually better for you, yes, more healthy for you, than KRAFT. Cost is about the same as well.<br /><br />But this comes with a little twist, ANNIE'S HOMEGROWN encloses WHITE cheddar, for a slightly different taste. Yes, there are a few other white cheddar brands out there, but again, check the box. This one really is healthier for you.<br /><br />So before you pick up the store generic or any other brand, you might want to take just a little time to read the package. You will find this one more impressive.<br /><br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."	2	5

1	B0070Y9TUG	A3SSM4EMGE4PPH	Great Salad Dressing	I was introduced to this excellent product during the Jewish season of Yum Kippur in December, when my local Ralphs market had a promotion of special foods for that holiday.  It is rare to find bottled salad dressings made with olive oil, rather than canola oil, soy oil, or safflower oil, which are the three major allergens.  Most people don't even realize they have allergies to these oils, but they could have a stomach ache after eating some.  I bought a number of these bottles when they were on special.  I have noticed that the bottles vary greatly with the amount of green flecks enclosed inside the bottle.  Some have a great deal, and others are almost green-fleck free.  I prefer the bottles with more green flecks, but I'm happy enough with those that have just a few.  Clearly, this is one of the very best commercially prepared salad dressings available.  The front label indicates gluten free/dairy free.  The ingredients are simple enough:  water, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, cider vinegar, salt, xanthan gum, garlic, onion, potassium sorbate (preservative).	0	0

-1	B000XR5MLW	A1RUHECPH9085O	Arrived melted from the heat	Saddly, I won't get to write a review about how the candy bars tasted because they were allowed to melt in the mailbox in 90 degree heat. The shipper Indulgence chose to carelessly ship the product in a USPS mailer that had no markings stating that the contents were temperature sensitive or perishable. Had they made that simple effort, my postman would have never left them to be destroyed in the heat. There was a cooling packet in the box but without any insulation...that effort was surely moot.<br /><br />When we contacted them about getting a replacement...they simply suggested that we wait until winter to order any Candy from them. Our suggestions to mark the packages fell on deaf ears. If you live anywhere that is warm at all...don't order and perishibles from them.	12	0

1	B000H23YNQ	A4UBQZG95VGGK	With this seasoned coating, it can't get any better	Dixie Fry is a seasoned coating mix that I have been using for over 15 years. I was looking for something different for coating my pork chops instead of using the Shake 'n Bake mix. I saw this product, read that it was good for coating not only pork chops but also chicken and fish. I decided to purchase a box on a trial basis. My family became hooked on Dixie Fry immediately. My husband and I have not changed up on the coating mix. We love the crunchiness texture on the pork, chicken and fish. It also has the right amount of seasonings. We would not buy any other seasoned coating mix, but this one - the best in the market.	3	0

1	B000ILK9UM	A3N4CUW4UYC9I3	LOVE this caramel flavor!!!	I absolutely love the Kernel Season's caramel seasoning.  I recently ordered many different varieties from the company's website.  I wanted to try several before committing to purchasing 6 of one type from Amazon.  I went through the caramel extremely quickly and ordered a 6 pack from Amazon.<br /><br />The main ingredients are sugar and brown sugar, so it doesn't quite taste like caramel.  It is very sweet and very good, though.  It definitely takes care of my sweet cravings.<br /><br />I found that I tend to used less of it if I use it on kettle corn (I use 94% fat free Orville) and a butter Pam-type spray.  The spray helps it stick and with the sweetness of the kettle popcorn flavor, I do not need to use quite as much of the caramel flavoring to be satisfied.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this caramel seasoning if you like popcorn and want to have a sweet treat!!	1	0

This may be ""organic"" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad."	3	12
1	B004NYDPCO	A33AQPJYH7UUXR	the secret to my faux tandoor* chicken tikka	While I love the taste of this stuff my figure just can't justify the extra calories unless it's an emergency. Consequently I don't use enough of it to make it practical to try the recipe that's been provided here in the reviews. I'll be content to shell out a couple of bucks on this brand because it is the key for a dish so wonderful I wouldn't change a thing including this particular brand/ingredient:<br /><br />Cube a couple of chicken breasts and saute in the coconut butter until lightly browned* - watch the heat carefully as the coconut butter can burn easily. Add one 14 oz jar of Tiger Tiger brand Peshwari Tikka Masala Simmer Sauce to the pan and simmer over low slow heat for 10 minutes. Add one small chopped onion and stir occasionally for three minutes more. Top with fresh chopped cilantro and serve over Jasmine rice into which some green peas have been strewn in and some Naan on the side.<br /><br />* cooking the chicken in the coconut butter mimics the delicate tenderness that happens when the chicken breasts are cooked in a proper tandoor oven.<br /><br />Enjoy!	4	0

1	B004867T24	A2F540P3L6P5CL	Two paws up from kitty, but the packaging leaves a bit to be desired	"As thrilled as I was to get a package of this for trial from Vine, it is not the kind of treat I'd normally pick up for kitty. 1) I'm cheap. 2) we do not do wet food or the soft/chewy snacks at all and 3) she's gung ho with stuff like this, eats too fast and then it's a bit of a barf fest on the carpet...<br /><br />OK, so the package comes, a supposedly reusable zip baggy thing, but while I opened it easy enough the first time, day two was another matter and I ended up cutting it open and putting it in my own easier to open zip bag. So much for that. The package contains three sticks of tuna (dolphin safe and all that according to the info blurb), measuring about 4 1/2"" by 1"" by not quite 1/2"" and a bit of broth of some sort. They are rather dense/dry in texture and I recommend breaking it up a bit by fork (or your fingers if the smell doesn't bother). I'm treating these as a snack, and not as a meal. They are a bit chewy looking, so if you have an older cat and/or one who has difficulty chewing I'd think carefully on these.<br /><br />Kitty loves them, and boy does it keep her busy eating after I'm home and not bellowing at me for attention :)<br /><br />A solid five paws from her, and I'm knocking off a star for the packaging issues and the price(!!). I supposed those who have a lot of disposable income would lap this up like a cat with cream, but as I said... I'm cheap (or frugal, as the boss puts it)."	1	1
1	B00448FZWM	A3OCKYJNMQMKBL	Delicious!! Better than Wild Bill's!	"My husband has been praising Wild Bill's for years now.  We saw it was available on Amazon, but by the time went to purchase it, it was no longer available.  So we got this one since it compares itself to Wild Bill's.  I can't say that it tastes much like Wild Bill's, but I like it better!!  Even my ""Only Wild Bill's will do"" jerky-loving husband said this stuff was beyond good.  We may not bother with ol' Wild Bill as long as we can get this one.  Buffalo Bill's is good to, but so far this is my personal favorite!

I cannot even begin to describe the taste.  We tried to pour this over different casseroles and the results ended up being thrown away.  Just not good and you cannot even begin to eat as a plain soup.

It is void of artificial sweetners that cause all kinds of problems for the body.  There is really nothing diet about the flavor or drinking experience.  It has every sense of a regular cola with sugar, without the sugar.  There is no after taste or lingering strange feelings after consumption.  It is purely a great beverage with no strings attached.  I see Zevia as a strong mainstream beverage of the future.  I believe in this product, and would invest futures into this company.	1	2

1	B005VOONI0	A32WYIUWD2HJHU	Dark and Rich and Very Good	I drink two cups of coffee each morning and I make them with a pod brewer. I used to drink more. I'd make a pot of coffee in the morning and drink it all day. Sometimes I'd do two pots. It seemed that just the thought of that coffee waiting for me was all it took to get me out into the kitchen and pour another cup. The pod brewer was the answer. Now I make a cup when I get up and have my second cup with breakfast.<br /><br />I do have several different kinds of coffee, but after having tried this, I've been mostly sticking with it, because it's dark and rich and very good with kind of an earth taste that I really like.<br /><br />In fact this coffee is so good that sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, I'll take a third cup upstairs with me to my home office. If you haven't tried this, I think you should. I think you'll like it.	0	1
-1	B000PDY3HI	A1WEZ958B8TTN2	Popcorn butter	Popcorn oil solidified once it was in my house. This does not do so well in my new popcorn machine. I have to squeeze the oil out of the compartment then microwave it to make it liquid,  then I have to put it in my popcorn machine. Also when my shipment arrived the box the popcorn was in, looked as though one of the oils had leaked. Not sure if this is normal for all of this to have occurred but I'm just not happy with the way the oil has set up like concrete in the package. I was not happy with the popcorn purchase.	0	5

They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said ""I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again."" My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain."	0	3

The hand harvesting provides the most amazing pyramid shaped flakes. I carry a small wood box of it with me in my purse and frequently get attention from other diners as I use it. The flakes are crunchy and have a unique flavor. I prefer it to most other sea salts I've tried including Hawaiian Alaea and Pink Himalayan.	1	0

Although the risk for thiamine deficiency is remote, the company is taking the extra precaution of voluntarily removing these products from store shelves and asking customers to return any of the affected lots. The company has also taken additional steps in their manufacturing process to ensure that this does not happen again.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I have been feeding Wellness for years.

1	B002YFZ7IY	A111A4KW1HLTBR	Excellent Quality!	When I first adopted my dog, I did a vast amount of research to find out what was truly best to feed him. He's a chihuahua mix, and as I was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not I decided I just had to try it for myself. He did have a little trouble with digestion while I was transitioning him to the food, he was eating Royal Canin prior. He's been eating it for about seven months now and he's doing phenomenal. He has great muscle tone and energy. His coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull. Yes, it's on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why wouldn't you want your best friend to benefit from great food.	1	0
-1	B000EDGB7E	AGGK2X8P26FFY	Messy Stack	The berry flavors permeate and dominate the other fruit flavors.  The bottom of the bag has dried fruit powder that sticks and stains your fingers and anything else you touch.  Think Cheetos.  Definitely will not be ordering again.	0	0
-1	B002AUCELQ	A3M9L03ALYIUL7	YUCK	I bought a package of these at Starbucks, and thought good crispy, hmmmm so I bought a case of a mix cinnamon, sugar, chocolate chip and oatmeal.  First they all tasted the same.  They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.	0	4
1	B00169Y3CU	A1YG8GNF3J4B6M	tortilla land uncooked tortillas	These tortillas come in packs of either 44 or 36 and also double packs.  They come frozen and don't leave them in the fridge too long, because they have no preservatives.  You just toss them on an iron skillet with no spray or anything, flip them over after they form bubbles, cook a few seconds more, and you have the closest thing to home made tortillas I have ever tasted.  They are the best.  each the same size and the same thickness.  So yummy I absolutely love these!	1	0

1	B000PSTGKW	A2ZWMAX2HILMX0	Looks great on counter but not a tight seal	Have been using this for a few weeks. I like how it looks on the counter, and I like having the salt within reach while cooking. However, it came out of the box with the lid hinge bent, and so the lid didn't lay flat on the glass bowl. We had to bend it carefully to get it to lay properly on top of the glass. (I didn't want to hassle with packaging it up to return it.) I'm not convinced it is a tight fit and I'm worried about moisture in the summertime. My 2 year old daughter adopted the teeny little spoon as soon as I opened the package, and I haven't seen it since. I usually just pinch the salt out with my fingers anyhow.	1	0
-1	B001EQ5428	A3OC7R8SK91FM	Change in blend?	"I am a long time lover of Caffe Verona whole beans.  However, I bought a bag two days ago and noticed that the bag design is new, and in addition the most prominent word on the front of the bag reads ""DARK"", unlike the prior design with the word ""BOLD"" being less prominent.  This would not be worthy of comment if the product tasted the same as Caffe Verona Bold.  After grinding for three mornings I am convinced that the formula or process has been changed.  If this one bag is not an anomaly, Caffe Verona is no longer my favorite--same for other family members who are also discerning coffee lovers."	1	1
1	B000FVMOW6	A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP	Sumac...	Sumac is a single spice not a mixture of different spices and majority comes in a black or very dark colour unlike this brand which is a lighter colour. It is used mainly in Persian dishes with rice and kabob. I use sumac in majority of my dishes since I love the taste and the smell of sumac so much. It is not hot at all. It is not sweet. It is a different spice but absolutely a necessity for me. Once in a while you will get a very small seed that you can not consume but that is the nature of this spice. Bravo.	2	0
1	B003PXY0XC	A3NQU1649SH0Q4	Delectable	"These little treats, the size and shape of regular M&M's from arch-rival candymaker Mars, have been going in and out of style since their introduction over thirty years ago.  A visual ""product placement"" in the 1982 movie E.T. gave them quite a boost, but several years ago I couldn't find any at my usual big box.  Pity.  But they are back, and they are still one-of-a-kind.  The taste is similar but not identical to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (a little sweeter and more 'buttery' to indulge a metaphor, but less peanut-y or salty).  Like M&M's, the candy is encased in hard shells; unlike M&M's they come in only three colors, orange, yellow and dark brown. I was stunned to see that the independent vendor from whom they are currently available wants the product price just to ship them (so my five stars are NOT for the current online price!).  But it should be fairly easy to price-compare."	0	0
1	B000EEWZC8	A810PNCBZXIYJ	An old favorite and I'll give some ideas for it	Back in the day, I used to just eat these right out of the tin.  I've always loved clams in any form.  Same is true for smoked foods.  You can't beat the combination of flavors.  But let me toss a couple ideas at you:<br /><br />1) Get the big scoop sized Fritos, add a blob of cream cheese and one of the clams.  Repeat until you fill a tray.  Easy hors'dourves!<br /><br />2) Big sushi rolls.  Add strips of cream cheese, the clams and some chopped green onion.  Yum!	3	0

Obviously, there's popcorn, and then there's popcorn!  Although some will probably complain because you have to cut the top off the package and squeeze to get the semi-solidified coconut oil out, it was no problem for me.  And certainly worth it!	0	0
-1	B001LQNHZW	A388IGNIWQJ27A	Misleading	This was my first time purchasing Manuka honey after discovering its benefits.<br />I bought it to use it as a mask and I put it on my face before I shower. I haven't really noticed any dramatic difference but my skin does feel smooth when I wash off the honey.<br />And it tastes really great.<br /><br />However, I was very disappointed when I read what it said on the package. Its 50% manuka honey and 50% rewarewa honey. Now I don't know what rewarewa honey is but if the title is going to say 100% pure, shouldn't it be 100% manuka honey? I am not an expert but i think it should say that somewhere in the description.<br /><br />Overall, I would not buy this again.	7	0

But after a year of use, I could no longer overlook the extremely fine white dust that was accumulating on my peanut butter jars on top of the refrigerator.

1	B004V3INKQ	A2JLJBI4F29YST	Great dessert coffee or just for everyday!	Like most Keurig owners, we have had so much fun trying various flavors.  We stumbled across this one at a Target and bought it immediately. When we got home, I couldnt get the k-cup in the machine fast enough. The minute the seal is broken, you can smell the raspberry. As it brews, the aroma that fills your house is divine...just like chocolate and raspberry. I do enjoy the Van Haute Vanilla but I feel it is a weak cup of coffee and I don't think the vanilla flavor is very strong. The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle is the opposite...the flavor tastes as rich as it smells. And man, it is amazing and smooth, not too overpowering.<br /><br />I think this would be the perfect after-dinner coffee or a dessert coffee served with biscotti or some other coffee cookie. It isn't too sweet though and makes a great cup of coffee for anytime of the day as well.<br /><br />I love this coffee so much wrote this review. Other coffees I like (but am not writing a review for) are: Island Coconut, Timothy's Decaf, Sweet Tea (iced), Dunkin' Donuts (any of them), Chocolate Glazed Donut and Sleepytime Tea.	9	0

He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out -- although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer, so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable - and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit, so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug-a-Jug, so I didn't buy those."	0	0

I don't know why, but I'm very happy about it as more nuts and fruits = happy me!<br /><br />My new am routine is certainly more nutritious ( and lower in sugar) than my former daily breakfast, which consisted of homemade cocoa (using unsweetened, european cocoa powder), almond milk (hardly any protein), agave & a marshmellow, along with a (zero nutrition) gluten-free cookie!	0	0
1	B001EPPM76	A1JI0N194W43D2	Does the job!	So, my dog, in an excited frenzy over the doorbell ringing, knocked onto the floor and broke my beautiful celadon whisk stand that I received as a gift in Japan (it was part of an entire tea ceremony set).  I was a bit upset, since the entire tea ceremony set held a lot of sentimental value.  I forgave the dog (it could have been worse -- he could have broken my chawan) and went onto Amazon to find a replacement whisk stand.  I bought the pack of 3 in case this ever happened again.<br />The product is very nice, almost identical to my previous whisk, so it fits in perfectly with my tea ceremony set.  It does the job at keeping my whisk looking like new, plus the pack of 3 keeps you set in case your dog decides to break more fragile objects.<br />These were packaged very well, and the price was great!	4	1

We've tried both this French Roast and the Fogchaser, and enjoy them both. We have not had any issues with grounds in the coffee. We keep them in a zip-lock bag after opening the 12 pack bag, so we have not had issues with them tasting stale (we drink them in about 2-weeks). I'm guessing that these cost less since they don't have to pay a royalty to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for using the K-Cup name and design.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive alternative to the K-Cup, these are a great choice!	1	0

1	B000CMIYYU	A13HRSMJ5TOWEZ	Surprisingly Good, Surprisingly Effective	"My throat was killing me today, and on and off this week.  I decided to make myself some tea despite the heat and sort through my old tea collection to cull some teas that the food pantry can use up better than I can.<br /><br />The Yogi cold sampler nearly went straight into the food bank box until I saw ""Throat Comfort.""  I scanned the ingredients and liked what I saw:  all recognizable and nothing that I'm aware of being an allergy risk for me.  (eg, no lemon grass . . . though companies can change their ingredients, so check the label on your box!)<br /><br />The relief was immediate.  I made a little surprised, happy noise at the first sip.  The pain relief doesn't last long between sips, but oh my, this feels good on a sore throat!<br /><br />This tea has an almost artificially sweet aftertaste to me, though there are no ingredients I recognize as sweeteners on the box.  It's probably the organic fennel seeds and organic licorice root, which are the top two ingredients.  I have strongly mixed feelings about licorice and will skip black jellybeans, but I always liked fennel.  This tea is delicious, and maybe a little too sweet or anise-y to take seriously as a regular daily tea, but for a sore throat it's heaven.<br /><br />I wonder which ingredients get the job done, as I have to confess I'm now a full believer in the product.  I drink green tea almost every day at work, and it's wonderful stuff but didn't help my throat like this did."	0	0

1	B000VJYTZM	A10G136JEISLVR	Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it	I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.	0	0

1	B0065S65QY	A20NVE1U6G8C7N	Hi quality raw sunflower lecithin	I read about lecithin years ago in an old nutrition book by Adele Davis, and decided to try it. I liked it, or liked the idea of taking it anyway, but stopped taking it when I learned that some health problems I was having at the time were related to soy in my diet. My health improved greatly when I stopped eating soy, but I missed the lecithin.<br /><br />I was happy to discover recently that other types of lecithin were available. One source is sunflowers.  I tried sunflower lecithin capsules, but was less than enthused about them.  Nothing wrong with them, but they felt like an inert food somehow, maybe because of the processing when it's put into the capsules.<br /><br />I found LoveRawFoods Raw Sunflower Lecithin online a few weeks ago and decided to try it. It's a little pricey, not so much the product itself, which is reasonably priced, but when you combine the product price with the shipping, it adds up.  But I'm glad I bought it.  I really love it.  It's great to be able to eat lecithin again after all of these years.<br /><br />To reiterate: sunflower lecithin is not like soy lecithin. Soy lecithin is an industrial waste product marketed for human consumption (made usually from genetically modified soybeans). It's toxic and bad for you.  Sunflower lecithin is a beneficial food product derived from sunflower seeds. And better yet, the LoveRawFoods brand is raw. Very cool.  It tastes like very fresh sunflower seeds.  I'll keep buying it as long as LRF keeps making it.<br /><br />If you're new to lecithin, I'd recommend mixing some into a smoothie, till you develop a taste for it. I actually eat it by the spoonful. But I know that's unusual :)Most people would want to mix it into some food.	23	1
1	B003Z7UR2Q	A2VCAWTDGOU4EP	This is the way to go.	"I picked up a bread machine at Goodwill for $10.  Works great and I love the fresh bread (and all the varieties of bread!  But buying the little packets of yeast or the little jars, is one of the most expensive components of the bread.<br /><br />So I bought a double bag of yeast here for about what two small bottles would have cost in the store.  That about halved the cost-per-loaf.  There's no discernible difference between this yeast and what I was using before. I just filled up the old bottles with yeast and stuck it in the fridge as my ""working supply"" and stashed the rest in a zip lock  bag and stuck it in the freezer.<br /><br />Of course, bread isn't the only thing you can use yeast for.<br /><br />I'll leave the rest to your imagination!"	3	0
1	B0077DMWO0	A25FJHY9KVSO8Y	if you haven't tried this product then you should	This stuff is so good. Sprinkled on potatoes and bake. OMG!!!! Every one loved the smell. So one day for a pop luck dinner I fixed a big pan of slice baked potatoes sprinkled with hebox. It was the hit of the dinner. So glad to see this product on her . will be getting some soon.

1	B0081XPTBS	ACAVHRZLL1N4X	Ours loves it!	I have been breastfeeding since birth, she is 11mo now & we began supplementing with 1 nite nite bottle per night at 6 mo old so we can get a little bit of sleep since we both work full time. (yep, pumping ALOT at work too, Medela in style double electric is a great pump!) She likes this this formula, no tummy issues or constipation for our little one so yes, I recommend this!	0	0
1	B003P9XG7M	A36PNZJBD369DX	Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Large Breed Senor Dogs	My dog, Petra, is almost 12 years old...she's a chocolate lab/chessie mix.  This has been a rough summer for her because her arthritis has gotten much worse with the heat.  Because of this, I switched to Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Large Breed Senior Dogs.  I've noticed much improvement in her energy level and her ability to get around since I switched.  I believe it has relieved some of her discomfort and she moves around better than she has.  I'm glad there's a product like this out there for my wonderful dog!	3	0

1	B004LDHEKQ	A3MHLBVV6FTWSW	Mmm! I love malted milk!	This was my first time purchasing malted milk powder, so I can't really say how this measures up to other brands. But what I wanted was straight-up malted milk, not chocolate malt, not a milk shake, just malted milk and this got me there! I just add a couple tablespoons of the powder and a little bit of milk to a mug, microwave it for 20 seconds, stir, then add the rest of my ice cold milk and stir again. Boom! Awesome cold malted milk. Delicious. I fill kind of silly for buying this 2.5lb container (especially since I finally found a reasonable size at a local store). But hey, I'm sure I'll use it :)	3	0

1	B001TLY7A8	A3P27PI9STEKY6	Great stuff	My cat likes Mideast Feast and Asian Fusion. He's not so crazy for the chicken or Marbella Paella, but I think it's more that he doesn't like non-fish and doesn't like shellfish.<br /><br />This stuff might be a bit expensive but I see it this way:<br /><br />With the wet food I used to buy, if I didn't take care and left some in my sink or garbage can for more than a few days, there will be small flies that emerged from it. With all the Weruva stuff, I've left some remnants out in my sink for a week and no flies. I really think the cheaper, more available wet cat food has something wrong with it to be spawning flies so quickly.	0	0
1	B0030VJ8PE	A20P8VC55KPPCT	Love all HappyBaby Tots!	My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!	0	0

1	B00061MVTG	A1RSZG1YN892HQ	Good, but dries out quickly	I have been using pill pockets now for about 2.5 years now EVERY DAY for my cat, Baby, for her heart medication. While she's come accustomed to the treat, and won't eat it on its own any more, she will most of the time eat it with other treats she likes.<br /><br />I have noticed, however, a few things: 1) If you don't close the package tightly and keep air out of it, the treats will dry out, and will become MOST undesirable to the kitty. My solution: put the treat bag in another zip lock sealed bag, squeeze out the air, and voila, treats stay fresher longer. 2) The treats for cats are actually VERY large (even for my obese and often hungry kitty!). My solution is to basically cut the pill pockets in half, and smoosh pill inside the pill pocket that way.<br /><br />I have been using the chicken flavor for the last couple years, and have yet to try the salmon flavor, but I'm really hoping the change will be quite palatable for my Baby! Thanks, Greenies, for making a great product that makes pilling my cat so much easier!	2	0
1	B001BCVY9W	A2NMQWBDWT3SQF	Looks almost like people food!	My family has two cats who are just over a year old.  We usually feed them dry food, but give them the canned stuff once in a while for a treat.  Our large sized male cat LOVES Petite Cuisine, and gobbles it up.  Our dainty little female though, refuses table scraps and won't touch any wet food, including Petite Cuisine.  My kids helped me to take notes on this food as we offered it to both cats.  The same thing happened with every flavor- little cat A sniffed it and walked away, while big fat cat B ate it up as fast as he could! I guess it's all a matter of preference.<br /><br /> I feel good about the fact that this stuff is natural and looks like food.  it is not full of fillers, and it has everything a cat requires for a healthy diet.  The cans are the right size for a single serving for an average to big cat, so there's no messing around with storing half empty cans of fragrant catfood in the fridge.	0	1

-1	B003ZT61E2	A3TSJ9KDY18X1L	just okay	The Peppermint Mocha latte from Maxwell House is okay, but it's not the greatest. I used the 4 teaspoons that the package reccommended and to me it tasted like hot sugar water. I added a few more teaspoons with no result in change of flavor. The peppermint flavoring starts out strong, but by the end you can barely taste it. I think the flavoring is strongest in the foam that forms at the top of the drink after the hot water or milk is poured. The mocha flavor is basically non-existant. I could not detect any mocha or chocolate flavor throughout the drink. A hint of coffee flavor is present but the whole drink was pretty bland to be honest. My brother tried the drink as well. He took a few sips then poured the rest of his mug down the sink drain. It just wasn't that great.<br /><br />It's a quick go to drink for those cold winter nights but I rather stick to my regular coffee or hot chocolate.	0	0
1	B000FPGYTQ	A1AJQUA9PEA90X	Taste great, not messy	My daughter officially gives these 5 stars - she just loves them.  These were her first finger food, and they remain her favorite.  I'll add my own 5 stars because they're an easy, convenient snack, and unlike Cheerios, they don't make a mess when the child is just learning to eat (the Cheerios were dribbling out of her mouth and onto her clothes); I suspect it's because the fruit puffs dissolve more quickly.  I'm not crazy about the price - 1.48 oz. isn't exactly a huge amount - but on the other hand, I don't give her that many, so a canister lasts a few weeks (vs. the recommended six servings).  Giving it in smaller quantities should also alleviate concerns about sugar in the product (sugar is the fifth ingredient in the banana puffs).	0	0

1	B005V9UG18	A1GQOL9AKA0FD2	vanilla disguise	Hidden behind the creamy vanilla flavor is a healthy organic list of veggies and fruit.  The protein curbs the urge to gag down junk food at work.  Often there is no time for lunch so I enjoy my Orgain and feel good about fueling my body well.  I have even used this one as a base for smoothies and it works great.  My favorite is the creamy fudge, but the sweet vanilla bean is delicious when I don't want chocolate.  Thanks for getting it home for free!	1	0

1	B000EH2QPQ	A1LO15609SA1Q3	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, QUALITY DOG FOOD!!!	I have 2 Pomeranians that both ADORE this food! They never get tired of it. Both the canned and the dry dog food, particularly the Chicken and Rice, are excellent. You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!	1	0
-1	B001D0IZBM	A3SQH1G9IUE8UR	Should be called Big Easy Bitter...	Others may love this k cup but I found it way too bitter.  I have to admit I don't drink that much bold coffee but have had a chance to try a few others and don't care for this one.  My Keurig only has the 8oz capacity and I took a cue from other users and run the bold k cups through twice to make 12 to 16 ounces depending on the type coffee.  Well even if I run this through twice at a total of 16 oz it is still too bitter... just not my k cup of coffee I guess but I do like Donut Shop and Newman's Own Extra Bold.	3	2
-1	B004MTM03A	A3CTEFTZW2XR70	what flavor is this??	i got this (dark chocolate) from my mom for easter, and being 22, im grateful for any present i get at my age. but this candy...i dont know..it just tastes funky. i tried all the flavors and none of them taste like the fruit its supposed to taste like; cherry and chocolate does have a slight sweet chery taste, but it only lasts for a split second and this is the only one that has a taste even remotly close to the fruit taste. the coconut one also has a fruity-ness to it, but coconut shouldnt be fruity... i love Jelly Belly jelly beans and i love chocolate and the idea of this candy is fantastic, however, they need to taste good....right??? i figure it had to be common sense but nothing about this is good..not even the chocolate tastes like chocolate. major fail on this product.	1	3
-1	B0001CVDZI	A3HGSTUCPZ4VNV	Good if you love VERY Salty Vinegary food	I saw all the great reviews on this item and decided to try it out myself.  I couldn't wait to cook up some jerk chicken for my friends.<br /><br />However, I was very disappointed when with the final product.  The paste itself was very salty and VERY VERY vinegary.  I thought cooking will mellow it out. It didn't.  I will not buy or even use this again.  The taste and the sharp scent of vinegar overpowers the other spices and the flavor of the meat.	5	9
1	B000G31KUA	A22Z9R91N8L7IQ	Good Sauce At A Good Price	I'm not going to say this is spectacular cocktail sauce; but it is quite good for a reasonable price and thus gets the five-star rating for Amazon purposes.  Beyond that depends on you.<br /><br />Whether you like it depends on your own taste buds.  It's different from the usual stuff you probably pick up in the grocery store.  A little more horseradish, more lemon and more tomato taste.  I found it good; and a nice minor change of pace.	0	0
1	B0032RPLSY	AUBK6N65OMI8	WOW - PURE WHOLESOME HEALTY BUTTER	I just took out my freshly baked whole wheat and rye bread out of oven, waited until it cooled down.. cut a slice and put some of that awesome ghee on top .. that is all no jam no nothing.. and this is definetly the taste I have been looking for. Pure natural butter taste, just even a little would do the trick. Wholesome butter taste just like my grandmom used to make back at home. I am not Indian, but still this is the pure and healty butter I remember from my childhood. I am not a typical review writer, but this Ghee deserved an extra effort. My kids love the taste as well.. We will never buy that famous store butter sticks anymore.	2	0
1	B00024896G	AYXTCZY73QIIS	great fish!	Polar Kipper Snacks.<br />These were (briefly) stocked by my local Supermarket chain (acme)  They are very superior to the flavor of the competitive products.  Perhaps it's because they are a German product, while the others are Canadian and U.S. sources.  Although this is a small purchase, the price, including the shipping, is worth it, especially since 18 cans should last me a few months.  A healthful and nutricious snack for fish-eaters like me.	9	0

1	B000CRQ2KI	A1ZO9D554VQO9F	Nice ingredients, but doesn't last long if your dog is a chewer	Based on my experience, this is a 3 star item for me, but I know my dog is a chewing/pooping exception, so this could be a good item for a lot of other dogs.<br /><br /> My dog, a greyhound, loves to chew bones, antlers, rawhides, stuff like that.  I don't like to give a lot of rawhide, and the antlers are good, but I thought I would try this one out for something different.  I gave it to her and in 15 minutes she was halfway finished with it.  I really did not expect that at all.  It feels hard like it would take her awhile to grind it down, but she was able to bite off small chunks of it at a time.  Being that she has a delicate constitution, I took it away from her after she ate half of it.  Needless to say her nighttime deposit was pretty loose, but hey, I can't be sure it was from the bone.  And to be honest, my other dog (who doesn't like to chew) can eat stuff she can't and have no troubles.  Still, I won't get her these again, I have yet to find anything that beats the chewing power of an antler!	0	0
1	B000NMJWZO	A7Y2IH39JP4NX	Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix	I have been on a gluten-free diet for the past 2 months.  Most of my cooking has been from scratch so I love this mix as I use my same recipes and don't even altar them at all.  I use this mix for my favorite roll and cut biscuits.  My favorite muffin recipe is the one on the back of the sack which is Pamela's Sour Cream Coffee Cake.  I use muffin tins and don't use the glaze.  This cinnamon and raisin filling is good but I also leave this filling out sometimes and add chocolate chips or blueberries for variety.  I also found a pie crust recipe on the internet that uses almond flour and brown rice flour.  I use Pamela's for the brown rice flour and it was great for our pecan pie at Thanksgiving.  At Christmas, I will put foil over the crust as it browned too much before the pie was done.	1	0
1	B005GXHKSG	A6BV2QFKLEX4O	like the taste	My girlfriend and I prefer Lavazza over anything. We prefer the crema that Lavazza seems to produce better than other brands. This Creme e Gusto is superb (for a pre-ground). We always prefer to grind our own beans but we like to have a backup that is pre-ground for company so we can quickly make espressos without a lot of waiting between cups. We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price.	0	0
1	B000LKTJUG	A2XBFVW4EE13AH	Excellent Tea	Kukicha is NOT and never has been green tea!  It is the stems and twigs of the tea plant picked when the caffeine is lowest and the calcium is highest in the plant.  It is a rich brown color with a woody slightly astringent flavor.  I find nothing more soothing than a cup of this kukicha tea and carry the tea bags everywhere I go.  I also use it if I begin to get a sty on my eye.  I brew a strong cup, soak a washcloth in it and apply it warm to my eye.  The sty is usually gone in a few hours.	6	3

I would not recommend their reg coffee, but the hazel nut cappuccino is the best on the market nothing to add just make and enjoy but i recommend not to use more then 6oz.serving size to get the best flavor, using a larger amount will weaken the flavor very important!they also have vanilla cappuccino and carmel cappuccino which are both very good also.	0	0

1	B005OPQF2I	AA0YPCLUF78B4	Great food, high price on Amazon	I just bought this at my local grocery this morning for a cat who has not been eating.  She gobbled down two containers!  I'm thrilled of course, and went on Amazon to order it in quantity...only to find Amazon's price is higher than my local grocery, which charges $1.29 per 2 oz pack and Amazon is $1.40.  That's 10% higher.  Of course, if I want to sign up for a montly subscription delivery, it brings the price down, but I have found that items sent regular 5 day mail wind up arriving damaged.  The last case of another cat food I ordered through Amazon arrived with three cans crushed and split open.  I had to throw them out.  And that's not the first time that damaged goods have arrived by subscription/regular mail instead of Prime.	1	0
1	B003YBH3NY	A84W5ACDGPQXE	Would be 5 stars, except for the bitter dark chocolate...	We're a Gluten Free family and love GoPicnic meals.  I like dark chocolate, and like that this chocolate is fair trade, but boy is it bitter!  If you eat it with the applesauce it tones it down, but the wife and young kids have trouble eating it.  I actually make the kids eat their chocolate first to make sure they get it down before eating the other stuff.  It is a hard sell for the little ones, especially when they LOVE getting the Almond Roca in some of the other GoPicnic varieties.<br /><br />We purchased the Tuna & Crackers GoPicnic in a different box design in a grocery store this week, and they had changed the chocolate out to a much less bitter variety by way of a little sea salt.  It is better, but still rough for the kids.  I understand that milk chocolate doesn't fare very well in a warm box, but surely they could add at least a bit of sugar to take the edge off.	0	0

"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7VYRA"">Snyder's of Hanover Cheddar Cheese Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> package claims these pretzels are bursting with flavor.

I'd guess the average size is 1/2"" x 3/4"" - 1""  of all different shapes because they are randomly broken.

-1	B004XXXOQW	A1DBDHWZ5I5564	Crunchy, dry biscuits (with a few raisins)	After searching for the old Sunshine raisin cookies and reading the other reviews of these biscuits, I decided to try them.  Make no mistake -- these are NOT like the Sunshine cookies.  These are dry, crunchy biscuits (no, they weren't stale, they're just crunchy), with a few raisins thrown in for good measure. Many bites have no raisins at all - just a plain, neutral-tasting biscuit.  I don't remember the Sunshine cookies being crunchy, so that was also a disappointment.  Also, $15.00 is a lot of money to spend on a tin of biscuits this size.  I couldn't find these in the Asian market near me, but that's the way to go if you want to try these out (way cheaper).  If you're looking for something similar to the sadly-discontinued Sunshine raisin cookies, this isn't it. Try Crawfords Garibaldi Biscuits - they're made with currants, but they're much closer to the original.	6	0

Nothing was wrong with the old flavors, but this new candy is too horrible to eat.  I could not finish the bag.	13	0

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

1	B005M16TWK	A29M09QBG9TZLP	This is my Phat Boy's FAVORITE flavor of Whiskas	"My precious young cat ""Phat Boy Cuddlecuss"" is a VERY picky eater and he has a very sensitive stomach which he takes medication for. He won't eat Science Diet, Blue, Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and just about any other expensive canned cat food there is. My vet even prescribed Science Diet ID for Sensitive Gastrointestinal and he ate that for about a week and then he'd never touch it again.<br /><br />As soon as I pull these Whiska's open he comes running. So far he likes all the flavors he's tried so far- Filet Mignon, Rostisserie Chicken (his favorite!), Tender Turkey and the 2 Tuna varieties. When you open these they have a lot of meat juices which looks just like meat juices that you'd have from cooking a steak and letting it rest correctly (au jus). It doesn't seem to dry out like other canned cat foods if you have some leftover.<br /><br />Usually, you can find these at Wal-Mart for .54 and other stores at .69 each. Whiska's usually has some great coupons for B1G1 if you go to their website. So, unless you just want the ease of having them delivered, you can find a better deal for these than they are listed here.<br /><br />Overall, these are great cat food for my picky eater with a sensitive stomach. For my 5 cats one of these split up lasts only through one feeding, but, I like knowing that they are always fresh. I'd recommend as this is the ONLY canned food that my Phat Boy Cuddlecuss will eat."	1	0

These, however, are different.  Yes, they are a little heavier than a granola bar, but not much!  Taste is similar to other Special K or Slim Fast snack bars, but I didn't get as hungry as quickly after eating one of these.<br /><br />My husband also tried one.  He thought the flavor was a little stale, and not as good as the Cliff bars (which I haven't had).

1	B004YV80O4	ADJMETBPYJL7Q	Easy and Quick Dinner	Draft Veleeta Utimate Cheesburger Skillets dinner is a quick way to serve dinner when time and energy is in short supply. Granted, it is far from gourmet, but the kids will probably eat it up.<br /><br />It's simple to prepare and all that you will need to provide is a pound of ground beef that you have already fried up in a pan. Then, add water and noodles. Once those are cooked, it is a as simple as adding the package of velveeta. Along with a vegtable, or salad, it's a decent meal whipped up quickly.<br /><br />The good news about the taste is that it's pretty good. However, I prefer a bit more seasoning and the cheese is rather bland. Perhaps sprinkling some sharp cheddar on top would brighten up the taste a bit. Overall, though, it's much better than its closest competitor, Hamburger Helper.	0	0

1	B00122CM60	A2QTDL1XR2HTX	Great Soup!! Very Versatile.	Many people, including myself grew up on this soup. It was one of the few vegetables I looked forward to as a kid. This is my favorite vegetable soup, and I pretty much judge all others against it. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to find this product in my area. In fact, I can't find it at all. It was refreshing to stumble across it here on Amazon. I had not previously purchased more than one bag at a time when I wanted it. But after ordering it in bulk, I found a few other uses for it.<br /><br />Normal Use- This soup is great just by itself. Add water and you are good to go. But it is best if you add your own touch to it. I suppose each family has their own way of using it. I like to add stew meat (as per the instructions), and also a little extra carrot, celery, potatoes that I have on hand. You could pretty much add any vegetable, or even some canned tomato product to make it just how you like it. It's an awesome launch pad for perfect vegetable beef soup.<br /><br />Camping- It is a great camping food to take along. Take along some frozen stew meat, a carrot, a potato, etc. Brown the meat in a dutch oven over some coals, throw in the sliced vegetables and let it simmer for an hour. Your friends will be amazed wondering how you made such a great soup without a bunch of vegetables, and spices. It's super easy and fills you up with some tasty warm nutritious food on chilly nights.<br /><br />Prepping/Food Storage- This is a shelf stable food that lasts a very long time just sitting in the pantry. It is also easy to use by just adding water. Perfect for emergencies, or times when you may be unable to get to the store. If you can simmer water, you can have a satisfying meal for the whole family with this stuff.<br /><br />Potlucks- I hate those times when at the last minute I remember I have a potluck to do at work the following day. No problem. Get the large crockpot out of the cupboard. Cook it however you like it that night, then store in the fridge. Throw it in the crock pot the next day an hour or so before the time. Just add some paper bowls, bag of oyster shaped crackers, and plastic spoons and you'll be bringing home an empty crockpot.<br /><br />This really is a very versatile great tasting soup. Perfect item to have on hand!!!	2	0

1	B00472I5A4	AJQD2WWJYOYFQ	Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!	Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.	0	0
1	B004ZQBCZ2	A7C7QG6O3ZHXD	Nice healthy food -Udate - New grain free flavors!!	I like this food for my dog. Avaoderm seems like a repudable company. Dogfoodadvisor is a good website to go to to find good information about all kibble and wet food. My dog likes this food, and did very well on it. Her coat was super soft and she had lots of energy. I just noticed during the summer months her urine burned the grass. After some reading on the subject I found that high fish and beef diets can increase the uric acid in dogs and cause burn spots on your grass. Once off the fish and beef soley foods the urin grass burns stopped.<br /><br />Update: Avoderm just came out with a revolving grain free line of kibble. Turkey, Duck, and Trout. My dog is on the Turkey and loves it. She is allergic to Chicken. Even though this has chicken fat in it, it's the chicken protein she is allergic to and chicken fat does not contain the protein. I buy thick slices of fresh, low sodium turkey at the deli and top the food with peices of turkey and she eats everything. I could barely get her to eat once a day and now she is eating 2 -3 times a day and seems to be enjoying it. So far Petsmart, and Webers is the only ones carrying it. I give the Turkey a 5 stars!!!	2	0

I don't personally buy-in to the whole ""improve your focus and boost your performance"" thing, but if you're like most Americans, you're lacking in vitamins and minerals, so drinking this can only help.<br /><br />The Acai Pomegranate is delicious; not too sweet, not too sour, and not overwhelmingly ""fake fruity"" flavoured. I recommend drinking this very cold; the closer it gets to room temp, the more you can taste the vitamins. With ice, you can hardly taste the ""healthiness"" at all!<br /><br />I love the simply slender packs because they're easy to carry in a bag, pocket, etc. and you can toss them in a desk drawer at the office. I don't love the eco factor of single-serve packs in general, BUT I took some solace in seeing that EBOOST is a member of 1% for the Planet, so at least they're giving back.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the earlier reviews re. mixability, foam, etc., although it didn't bother me nearly as much as it did others.  I also mixed it with more than 8oz of water and it was fine - in fact better, in my opinion."	1	0

It's flavored sugar with candy that you lick and dip in the sugar so as to eat sugar with your candy that is mostly pressed sugar.<br /><br />That said. It's sooo good. And if your parents let you have it they obviously loved you because no one ACTUALLY wants to hand a kid a bunch of sugar and say, ""GO FOR IT!""<br /><br />At least that's my take on it.<br /><br />-Mike"	6	0
1	B0098WV8F2	A3MWMDQ9UELP7Z	YUM	"I've been hearing recommendations for PB2 for quite some time, but I couldn't find it in my local stores. I finally broke down and ordered it here.<br /><br />If you're into things like smoothies or cooking with peanut butter, this is a great product! It significantly cuts down the calories and fat without forgoing taste.<br /><br />I think for straight up eating the texture leaves a bit to be desired. So if you're looking for an alternative for your PB&J sandwich, give ONE container a shot and see what you think before spending too much for a bunch.<br /><br />As for the ""cocoa"" flavored version - it isn't overly chocolatey."	1	0

You don't have to visit the fine eateries in New Orleans to get fresh pralines anymore thanks to the internet. Each praline is sealed in plastic separately which means less exposure to air that keeps them fresh longer.  Save some $$ and get the larger box and save on the shipping.	1	0

I love this tea and buy it in bulk but the last time I purchased 16 boxes and over half were flavored with anise and had a terrible licorice flavor. Apparently quality control is a problem. In addition I received peach tea flavored cherry and thou I love this tea and hate the thought of being without it, fear reordering it unsure of what I will receive, but if you are fortunate enough to actually receive what you ordered, their Golden Mango Tea is out of this world.

I'm not sure what buckwheat is suppose to taste like, a lot of reviews say to be open minded on the taste which confuses me. This cereal tastes like a less sweet version of Frosted Flakes to me. It's really good, perfect amount of crunch. I love the taste, but it's nothing special. I wish it had more of a sweet maple taste. It's kind of bland.	0	0

1	B0051NHI7O	A3RXH1BJX6YWWS	Best Almond Extract Ever	"So many people recall the fake taste of yesterday's extracts, so they don't buy them or try them today.  BIG MISTAKE.  You should run, not walk, to the nearest store and load up on Rodelle Organics extracts.  They taste like the absolute essence of lemon, almond, chocolate, vanilla-- and anything you make with them comes alive with flavor.  Add them to a cake mix to transform it from a ""mix taste"" to homemade.  You will fool everyone, I swear.  They're amazing in pancakes, cookies, anything you already love but wish had a different zing now and then.  Put almond in your frosting, put lemon in your waffles, put any of them in creamy sauces and you will go wild.  This is the best brand out there, so become famous for your brownies and cheesecake, already!"	0	0

1	B004TPKAN4	A36RJG7HHV45TQ	Very nice, but not amazing	Dairy free! (Not just lactose free; I have a milk allergy, and I can eat these. Big bonus.)<br /><br />Plus side: On a cold, rainy day, I was all smiles to have these at my desk at work ready to dunk in a cup of hot orange & spice tea. That was a wonderful combination, and I was very happy.<br /><br />Down side: I don't know that these actually taste any better than the ginger snaps I often pick up at Big Lots, which are definitely cheaper (and still milk free).<br /><br />Bottom line is that they were very nice, and I have no complaints at all--except that I blew my diet eating too many of them at once!	0	0

1	B003YBJA1W	AOA3584MKVW4F	Favorite Crackers	I am not usually a cracker person, but I discovered these at our local grocery store in Seattle and then found them at a good price on Amazon.  I have an unusual affinity for Saltines, so this should give you an idea of my cracker tastes.  That said, I serve these often with a variety of dips and people always comment on how good they are (the crackers and the dip!) These crackers are what I would call a grown up version of a saltine.  They have an excellent crisp and are great for topping and dipping.  There are many varieties of the Croccantini, but my favorite is still the original.  They also come in larger versions that taste just as great, but are huge and tend to break up quite a bit.	0	0

(as well as others from this brand)<br />I would like to mention that I like the fact that the cereal is packaged into a carton box. What could be better, safer and healthier? I wouldn't want the cerial my baby eats to see packaged in something else (and get into contact with that ""something else""). Maybe it's not as convenient (as the previous reviewer mentioned,though the question of conveniency is arguable) but piece of mind and health of my baby surely makes it worth to deal with the packaging!"	1	0

1	B007PA33KM	A3TP31S61PPE3G	Smooth ideal blend - not too dark and not too light and no bitterness	Caribou Coffee is one of my favorites in spite of the fact I have to order the regular type online since we don't have any where I live. I ran into these K-cups at Target and thought I'd give them a go.<br /><br />I have occasion to offer people coffee in my office and the K-cup Keurig brewer is perfect for this as it makes just that cup for that person and it's fresh. Without exception everyone I served this too has loved it and asked for the name to purchase for themselves. It is full flavored but not dark and it has a very smooth taste with no bitterness (this is important to me..I find many K-cups to have a bitter aftertaste that affects the aroma of the coffee as well). A normal adding of cream and sugar works fine as well - you don't need more or less than your usual (again helpful when you are making it for clients and such).<br /><br />This is THE favorite for my office and one we will continue to purchase. Enjoy!	1	1

1	B007S2QQGU	A1UMDSV9N8F343	High Quality Pain.	This is one kicker of a drink. My mother bought this for me as a present because she knows that I like both spicy and vodka. Well, her intentions were true, and it is a thoughtful gift, but I just cannot handle the flavor. I need to find a few good recipes for this to drink it, as anything I have mixed it with leaves it too spicy. Straight is brutal. I took a shot straight, and the vodka stripped away my saliva (my spicy protection layer) and the capsaicin dug in deep. It tastes so good, but the spice is like a sucker punch right in the jollies. Buy this if you don't plan to use it as a main feature in your mixed drinks, or you need a good spirit for doing bets. I hope you enjoy it!	0	0
1	B003YBNK9K	A24Y5FHE3AA8E9	YUM!  ICED COFFEE!!	Great Stuff and only about a $1 per serving.  I throw in ice and a drop of creamer with the milk.

-1	B000KV61FC	AN0HDZTZJXK09	Hard to interest my pooch.	I have a 16lb Dachsund and we have a very hard time finding toys that she is interested in. We adopted her, and her home before us was as a breeder at a puppy mill where they kept her in a crate her whole life. So long story short, she has no idea what to do with toys and really, I'm out of ideas. She gets interested at first, but has a really hard time manuevering the bottle to get the treats out (she has had back surgery to repair paralysis in her hind end from ruptured discs so is not super agile). Also I think my little wiener has a little trouble figuring it out and I'm not sure how else to show her. I do like to toy and it has withstood her frustrations but I think I need more help with it.

"I, along with many others it seems, emailed Twizzlers when they changed their chocolate Twizzlers formula and made the twists with open ends.  I kind of forgot about it and converted to eating the strawberry ones because I just hated the new formula.  Well, they must have kept some kind of database because that was like several years ago and I just received a letter stating that due to consumer response they were bringing back the classic twist!  I also received a couple of coupons.  I must say I was impressed!  I did just find them in the store and they have the old shape back and I'm pretty sure the old taste too although the package still says ""made with Hershey's syrup"" and it didn't used to say that.  Another co-worker tried them and she too, thinks it is the old formula.  Thanks Hershey's!"	5	1

The cookies are delicious and look great, and  Beautiful Sweets has a whole variety of themes for year-round occasions.<br />One very minor issue, I wish the product page had specific information about shipping times. It took Beautiful Sweets about a week to ship my order; there's nothing wrong with that, but it would just be nice to know, especially when you're used to Amazon shipping everything so quickly.<br />On the positive side, they emailed with tracking number as soon as the package shipped.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more from Beautiful Sweets in the future.

1	B000PEEBYC	A4FA596FT20SN	Instinct Grain Free Chicken Meal Dry Dog Food	"I have an 8 year old 8 lb toy fox terrier. With other dog foods he gains weight and eats a lot more at a time than he does with this Instinct dog food. I researched dog foods and tried to find ones that were the best and this is one of them.  I feed him and he eats the right amount of this daily and maintains a more healthy weight.  This dog food doesn't have a strong ""dog food smell"". It will take some time for him eat this size bag but the bag shelf life is good for this brand and it has a good tight bag sealer on it.  I put enough for a week in another container so I don't have to open this large bag very often.  I also have this on a quarterly automatic purchase with amazon and will save even more by buying the larger bag.

1	B007RTR8UM	A2VJJ2POCLMED7	Pretty good...conditions well & seems to make thinner hair more full.	"Of all of the Clear conditioners I've tried, the Volumizing Root Boost is probably the one I've liked the best. Like a lot of guys my age, my hair has started to thin a bit in the front, so anything that will make that less noticeable gets my vote. I've tried more than a few products, and most don't do much of anything. Fortunately, the Root Boost not only conditions well, leaving my hair soft and manageable, but it also seems to actually ""volumize"" the roots and hair shaft, making my thin areas look a good bit better (especially on the days that I use Nizoral).<br /><br />The only real negative, in my book, is the scent. It doesn't smell bad, but it's a bit more perfumed than I'd like. The good thing is that Clear Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing conditioner rinses out very well (no oily film in my case), so the scent ends up being much more subtle (and pleasant) than it would seem at first.<br /><br />Clear Volumizing Root Boost conditioner delivers what it promises, and really does a great job on my hair. It's definitely going to be a regular purchase from now on."	0	0

-1	B008O3G25W	A2L35P0VQE7LBN	Roller Jams, Wasted Product	The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.	1	1
-1	B004PXEZAE	AX58YMRGBMYIY	Messy, difficult to use new bag. Less popcorn.	Pros:<br /><br />The popcorn tastes the same as it always has. Good.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The plastic pop-up bowl packaging doesn't work very well. It's difficult to open. If you're not careful you'll end up spilling the popcorn all over the place while trying to open the bag. You might also burn yourself.<br /><br />I know some people like to eat out of the bag, and if you do you will find this experience quite messy. The plastic portion of the bag does not soak up the oil like a traditional paper bag, so it gets all over your hands.<br /><br />After popping 4 bags in 2 different microwaves, I have come to the conclusion that these new bags simply do not pop as well as the old ones. I have more unpopped kernels, and visibly less popcorn when I pour it out into a separate bowl to eat (which I prefer). And 1 of the 4 bags leaked some oil into the microwave.<br /><br />The new bags are smaller than the old ones; 2.69 ounces compared to 2.9 (which used to be 3.3 ounces not too long ago.) Is this new packaging really just a scheme to hide a price increase?<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />2 stars.<br /><br />Start with 4 stars for the taste; about as good as microwave popcorn gets, but not as good as homemade. Subtract 1 star for the smaller package, and another for the messy new bag.	0	0

-1	B000GW46D4	ALJN039DSSX5E	Try it in strip form and from somewhere else	I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer.	2	2

I don't buy mine, by the way, anywhere but at Target, where they're $9.95 for a box of 18. I usually buy 5-6 boxes at a time (they sell out quickly). For the decaf equivalent of this, the French Roast (also Green Mountain's brand) is equally as bold and flavorful. Happy Holidays!	11	0

The sunflower seeds were good and fresh. I CANNOT cost justify buying this item. I won't purchase this again.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />My son rated this 3-Star because of all the seeds and their freshness, HE wants it again! I rated it 1-Star because of all the seeds.

The second order has the pictured blend of sunflower & pumpkin seeds, juicy raisins, almonds, cashew pieces all fresh. I'd give this batch 5 Stars.

1	B00370XQ5G	A2WCO7VO4H874J	Good superhot with a bit of flavor - No where near 4 million	"A friend brought over a bottle as a gift and I loved it enough to hop on and write a review.<br /><br />I'm just arm chairing this, but I'd put it at somewhere in the range of 300K scovilles, or somewhere around half the heat of ""Pure cap"" or ""Mad dog 357 with bullet"". I tested the three side by side with a dab on the finger, dubious of the 4M claim. Maybe they mean it was made with 4 Million extract before diluted with the vinegar?<br /><br />The thing with all those superhots is that after a point it really doesn't matter. They don't have flavor, and you can always just add in a few extra drops. (I still appreciate the novelty!)<br /><br />Either way, it is aggressively priced, nice and hot, and unlike the other two sauces I've mentioned, has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being 'spicy oil'. I like it!<br /><br />This is certainly going to become one of my regularly stocked hot sauces! It would go really well in a bit of soup, pasta, mashed potatoes, pizza, chicken wings, and so forth."	0	0
1	B001E5E2FY	A12ENBT314RFXR	Hands down, the best brand available.	The gluten free community holds a few long standing favorites among pasta brands. Tinkyada is one, and this should be the other number one. This pasta holds up, not only to cooking, but to reheating and stirring. I was introduced to this brand a few years ago when a friend brought me a box of their zitis and I fell in love with them. At the time, they were not available in my local grocery stores, so I was not able to get them. However, my stores began carrying the brand and now Amazon is offering the discounts for bulk, which always makes a great deal even better.<br />The cooking time on these guys is a bit shorter than the standard for gluten free noodles, but it does not make it easy to over cook them, either. I enjoy this great pasta with herbs and butter, in pasta bakes, or slathered with red or white sauce.	2	0

Vomit stains carpets, beds, shirts. You will find hard, old fossilized vomit under beds occasionally too.  Entire rooms of carpet will need replacing.<br /><br />If you have all wood floors and love cat vomit, go for it.<br /><br />However, it is a beautiful decorative grass when potted on it's own or mixed with herbs. Just keep out of cat's reach. Good air freshener if you grow enough indoors.<br /><br />No idea why people want cat vomit indoors though.<br /><br />3 stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more.	0	2

-1	B000PDWBKO	ASY25YMTIC2A9	Varying Freshness Ruins What Could Be Great Popcorn	My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand.	1	1

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.	2	0
1	B000CQC064	AD4V1MK2Q0VL7	Tea Devotee from Way Back	I've never been a coffee drinker.  I've only drunk tea since I was a child.

I drink it very strong with half & half and love it.  However, unlike the Irish, I can only drink it in the morning.  I heartily recommend this full-bodied, wonderfully flavored tea.  It's everything a good breakfast tea should be.	0	0

We've been using it for years for a pup that seems to have every food allergy under the sun, and he's thrived on it.<br /><br />In one month (Aug-September, however, the price jumped from $59.99 to over $78.00 (for you non-math people that's a 30% increase).<br /><br />This bag was the anchor of my monthly Amazon order, but now that the price has made it un-economical to buy through Amazon, I will parcel out my orders to have a more economical result.	0	1

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

-1	B00595JJ76	A2GTZFN42XXJU9	STOP, Read this review before consuming this product	"Ask a Chinese friend about ""forbidden rice"" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  ""Forbidden rice?""<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as ""forbidden rice"" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf."	3	13

I made it for the first time tonight and OMG. This bread is soooooo amazing!! I have done different homemade loaves and loved Udi's but was getting burnt out. I found Pamela's to be very moist, springy and does not crumble like others have. The flavor almost reminds me of a sweet version of sour dough bread. I trimmed the edges some and got the equivalent of 9 sandwiches, using my electric knife. I am absolutely thrilled with our new bread!!! It's a keeper!	1	0
1	B001EO5RCM	AWVFB7M6ICGZI	Good cereal!	"First I'll say that if you are not used to taste of buckwheat, the cereal may be one of those ""acquired taste"" things. For me, there is an aftertaste only for the first few bites and then I don't taste it anymore. I find it to be a really good gluten-free cereal. And it's not dry and chalky like some. It's very crispy, but I'm one of those people who can have no to very little milk in cereal so maybe I'm not a good judge. My kids eat it with plenty of milk, though, and love it. The recipe for trail mix on the back is really good. I make it with half of the recommended amount of honey and use agave nectar for the other half."	0	0

These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste.

1	B001TM70V0	A2UCTEKSGSF7LI	Weruva is top quality and this flavor is *MY* cats' favorite	"I've tried many different vendors and varieties of canned cat food and this is the favorite for *my* cats' (two of them) by a long shot.  *Your* cats may not like it.  Cats are very finicky!<br /><br />My advice to any reader is to learn about quality pet food (take an hour or two on the web, there's plenty of material to read) and then shop for top quality pet food only (Weruva qualifies in my opinion) and try a small sample until you find a set that YOUR cat likes. Rotate here and there for variety... if your cat likes variety, that is.  Both of my cats hate fish, love poultry and pork, and will tolerate other meats such as beef and lamb, and they both like a little variety.<br /><br />I wish I had fed my cats canned or even raw food from early on but I made the mistake of listening to an indoctrinated vet and fed them ""prescription grade"" Hill's Science Diet kibble which is total crap as I have come to learn from my own research. Like most doctors with humans and the pharmaceutical companies, many vets become distributors for pet food vendors for financial reasons and won't recommend something that doesn't make them money.<br /><br />I now feed my cats this Weruva flavor and a couple of other quality canned cat foods (they don't care for any other Weruva flavor, by the way) plus a couple of quality kibble brands (high protein, grain-free - no corn, wheat, or soy)."	0	0

I recently had a few of their 'too-cute' line that i bought off their website at a community event (penguins, strawberry's, puppies) and it was amazing how many people came up to my booth asking about them.

The vendor that I purchased them from is very thorough; several emails were sent updating me on the status of my order and it's upcoming delivery. The price was extremely reasonable.  The best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day.  A guilt free doggie reward!	0	0
1	B0029K38GC	A3IDMPP0ZFW1XM	Simple, quick, and easy for on-the-go!	I was looking for a bunch of different options for on-the-go lunches that would not require a refrigerator. I ended up getting a pack of these Easy-Mac to-go cups since I loved easy-mac as a kid. They worked out pretty well!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Easy - very simple instructions, no additional stuff needed (except about a cup of water). Following the instructions on the pack yields the exact advertised product<br />2) Quick - 3.5 minutes in the microwave!<br />3) Similar to stove-top Easy Mac - taste is very similar to the stove-top version. Though consistency is not (see below).<br />4) ample cheese sauce - my gripe with Easy Mac is that sometimes it lacks in the cheesiness (compared to other quick-type macaroni and cheeses such as velveta). This comes with a pretty good size pack of cheese mix, and definitely carries through in execution.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) noodles are a bit mushy - This is obviously not fresh, homemade pasta,  and the noodles are a little mushy after cooking in a microwave on high power. Doesn't particularly bother me though, but if you're a pasta snob (cough, Scott Conant, cough), you may wanna steer clear.<br />2) Takes a while for sauce to thicken - The instructions require that you add the cheese sauce mix after you microwave the pasta alone. Then you stir for a while until the cheese sauce thickens to your liking. It will take a while. In my experience, expect to face an additional 5-7 minutes of stirring the hot pasta with sauce before it thickens to the traditional consistency of Easy Mac (ie. macaroni and cheese).<br />3) Small portion - I'll admit, this is probably an item that is targeted for children, but in any case, it's a fairly small portion. More of a snack than a meal. Then again, I don't think I'd really like an entire meal of Easy Mac...<br /><br />Overall, it's a small pack that's easy to throw in my bag on days I don't have access to a fridge to keep my lunch cold. It's quick, easy, and requires no additional items to make (again, aside from water). If ever I need this kind of item again, I will definitely purchase!	1	0

-1	B003WREBIK	A3NRF4OEDRJOXS	Very low calorie, but I don't think it's for me :(	"I was very excited to hear about Arctic Zero products, as I'm always looking for lower-calorie, natural snacks to incorporate into my healthy diet.  After checking them out on Amazon and reading some good reviews, I headed to the local big-box natural grocery store to buy one of each of the flavors (they're slightly more than half the Amazon price there).  Even the cashier commented that she'd heard good things about this brand, and that the Cookies and Cream flavor seemed to be customers' favorite.<br /><br />After trying this flavor last night, however, I don't think I'll be buying these again.  As other reviewers have said, the color is different from a typical, off-the-shelf cookies and cream ice cream, although that doesn't bother me because I'm used to all-natural foods being different in color than their synthetic counterparts.  What did bother me, however, was the taste - I would NOT classify this as overly sweet as some other reviewers have. In fact I'd classify the flavor as slightly bland, with no cookie flavor whatsoever.  In fact, I checked the container to make sure I hadn't accidentally gotten the maple vanilla flavor out of the freezer, since I'd bought that flavor as well.  In addition, I felt that the texture was ""off"" somewhat - not grainy or anything, just more viscous than a normal ice cream (it seemed to ""coat"" my mouth for a long time after I ate it).<br /><br />All in all, I ended up eating about 3 teaspoons of this and putting it back in the freezer - great for portion control, but I'd rather spend my calories on ice cream that tastes good rather than eating something non-appetizing just because it's low in calories.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the other flavors of this product might appeal to me more than this one did!"	0	0
1	B004DC9BCO	A2LJZOZHTOKBOB	Pretty good cookie!	I first had these in England and have been wanting to eat them again.  They came well packaged; each individual package was wrapped in bubble wrap.  However, the first few cookies in the first pack (I've only eaten the one pack so far) were a bit broken and crumbly, but the rest in the package were fine.  The cookie is not overly sweet, and the sweet taste mostly comes from the chocolate coating on the top.  While they are not the most delicious cookie made, they are quite good and bring back fond memories.	0	0

1	B000AYFCF4	A19SDJ2TSSL8HI	Big Chocolate Taste	I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.	0	0

1	B0005ZYKCE	A2FFAC8S1KZ1IX	This Stuff is Terrific	This stuff is s-o-o-o-o much better than any other product I've tried. Indeed, the quality of this product can exceed the taste of fresh-squeezed lime juice if you aren't careful about choosing your limes. I've ordered six or seven over the last year or so and only one had a taste that was just a bit off. Again, I don't do better with lemons.<br /><br />I have amended this review owing to an angry - perhaps understandably so - comment indicating that some people may have a severe allergic reaction to the preservative in this product. I did some research and found that while such reactions are quite rare, they can be very serious. As such I will add to my review a very serious caveat that people allergic to sulpher dioxide should avoid this product. I don't know whether the amounts of that substance in this product are sufficient to trigger such a reaction, but, certainly it is better to act with caution.<br /><br />What I absolutely can vouch for is the quality of the taste of this product which is nearly impossible to distinguish from freshly squeezed limes.	2	0

1	B002AU4V94	AXX69ZTG6W47S	Best ever	Glad I gave them a try. They are expensive, but all gluten free foods I purchase are! They taste the closest to the best cookies I used to purchase before having to go gluten-free. Will purchase  again.	0	0
-1	B004I2FGQE	AKOYMM5TTRIHQ	hmmmm there is something missing here	I love iced coffee!  I can drink it morning noon and night, however, this missed the mark.  It was bitter and not what I had hoped for.  I will continue to purchase other illy products, but this one will stay of my list.  Great if you like bitter, not so great if you are looking for a smooth bold taste.	0	1
-1	B004R8L71W	A3KDO3XV0MK1GX	Tastes the same as regular Kraft.  Be aware of smaller size though.	This Kraft Mac and Cheese is trying to stand out in the marketplace by using cauliflower pasta.  Don't worry if you dislike cauliflower- this tastes the same as standard Mac and Cheese pasta.  You do cook it for a minute less than the regular product.<br /><br />While you may be interested in buying this in order to get the vegetable serving, keep in mind you are paying about the same price for a smaller box (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  The silver lining in this is that the calories in an entire prepared box are much lower in this veggie version (750 vs 1200 calories).<br /><br />This product may be useful for sneaking veggies into a kid's diet.  But the veggie amount is low, so you are better off adding fresh vegetables to a regular box of Kraft Mac and Cheese.	0	0
-1	B000PG1D1O	A38AKD7TL2WWCR	Did Nothing	I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.	0	2
1	B003O7AF8I	A1S8P1RGRCDWTH	Authentic Tasting & Delicious	The first time I ever tasted Gulab Jamun was at my parent's friends' home where we had been invited for dinner.  They were from India and everything we ate that evening was homemade including this lovely dessert.  Spicy World Gulab Jamun remind me of the fantastic homemade ones I had previously tasted.  Syrupy, sweet with a nice hint of cardamom.  Would have given 5 stars except that the packaging was a little rusty on the outside.  I did check the expiration date and made sure it was properly sealed.  I'm planning on purchasing these again, hopefully the cans will be in perfect condition next time.  Thanks Amazon!	0	0
1	B002OK6E6I	A20GKAF1SCZOXU	Perfect Alternative For Children With Peanut Allergies!!	We have tried several different alternatives to peanut butter due to my sons peanut allergy. Sunbutter is by far the absolute best we've tried but it's extremely hard to find in stores and when you do find it it's over $7 a jar!<br />This 6 pack was a great deal!!! I was worried about buying so many at a time considering the same thing purchased in the stores only had about 3-4 months till the expiration date. However, the 6 pack I ordered on Amazon doesn't expire for almost a year!!! Very happy with this purchase! Thanks!!!	0	0
1	B000OSJJ1E	A23OB5CPZGM255	Great size container, product packaged well...	I was pleasantly surprised when these arrived, as the sizes of the multi-color circles were very nice (not too small nor too large).  To date- I've found that they make great cupcake toppers,, they also make cute little rainbow circles on  one of the cake layers to give it some fun and dimension.  They're thin, but not too thin, they're not fragile but they certainly don't take over the tast of the icing on the cake, but they certainly do some pizzaz to the cake when finished.  I hope that each of you enjoy using these as much as me!	1	0
1	B0017M5V9A	ASL0FYNNBIQJ8	THESE THINGS WORK!	I'm on my second order of these.  With the first order earlier in the year it took a while, but the word finally got out in Mothtown and now these traps in my house are filled with male clothes moths looking for a hot Friday night on the town.<br /><br />Maybe the heat of summer has caused the second order to work faster, but one of the traps I received in early August caught no moths the first two nights, twelve on night three and ten more on night four.<br /><br />Order number three coming up.	0	0
1	B000X60V82	A39AY96I9G7P6U	Just like it was in my lunch box!	In these tough economic times, we long for a bygone era when things were easy.  Receiving this instantly transported me to my grade-school cafeteria.  I had no bills to bay.  I had no worries and I had Lowerys Beef Jerky.  I was 5 again for just a moment.  The recipe is the same.  The only thing that has changed is the packaging.  I remember each stick having it's own plastic packaging and there being an indian on the front of the tube that held all of the packages.	0	0
1	B000VK33C6	A3HZYNGMX9Y5E7	So far so good!	I was a little skeptical about switching over to this brand but I'm happy to say, my dog loves this stuff. I don't even need to add leftover meat scraps or gravy sauce like I did to his old food. This stuff is way better than the crap they sell at those chain stores. Can't beat the price with S&S! Also love that they come in smaller resealable bags which keeps the food fresh. Better to open up a brand new bag every couple weeks than to leave a huge opened bag of kibble in the pantry for months.	2	0
1	B006N3IE6A	A35OY2ASP1MP5M	Good flavor & strength	I like the Jamaica Me Crazy better, but when it's out of stock, this is my second choice.<br /><br />It's got a nice flavor & strength, without being bitter.	0	0
1	B000EEWZBE	A3FLNCYFL7465Q	Sardines are Better When Packed in Oil	I've been looking for these to appear on Amazon for a while because I like sardines in oil better than those in water.  The oil helps them slide down better and the oil gives a bit more flavor. I'm saddened to see they've used soy bean oil, I'd rather have them in sardine oil or olive oil; soybean oil is OK for printing inks and such but shouldn't be fed in any form to the unsuspecting public.  Oh, well, beggars can't be choosers.	1	0

1	B005AKJD6C	AWTV8ON00K2ES	Just like in the movies	I didnt buy it from amazon I found it in Borders Book stores, seriously they had a whole Harry potter section just like Barnes and Nobles. I digress, I dont know what the heck possessed me to taste the vomit flavor one but blech...it was so gross, although there were some good ones too. Grass taste just like grass lol, I was too chicken to taste any other flavors after getting vomit and the earwax..it was gross...gross but still pretty fun	1	0

1	B000FE5SDA	A2894EMZJVNYBQ	Toss-up winner between Big Hunk and Snickers	Used to eat this candy back in the mid 1960s as a little kid, and had not eaten one since until 2010.  Wow, nice that the Internet has solved one of life's little mysteries, as Big Hunk lives on!  Great taste, and unlike my other favorite candy which is Snickers, one can't wolf down a Big Hunk in a few blinks of an eye.  One has to slow down and take some time to devour a Big Hunk, and that's good for the taste buds.	0	0
1	B003BGRUPI	AQF2SMXB950D9	Great Green Tea and Great Company!	"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."	12	0
-1	B000E1694G	A30KCQIU856SEH	Reliable lunch to keep at work	I like these soups because they are filling, tasty, convenient, and sometimes cheaper to buy through Amazon. I send them to my daughter so she has a quick work lunch, and now her son liikes them as an after school snack. The sodium is a bit high but much better than other instant noodles.<br /><br />Also good for earthquake and emergency kits, though they need some water to rehydrate.	0	0
1	B0078Y6OX8	A2QB72NT6HE6WA	WOW!	This coffee has a great flavor!  I am not sure if I would say creme brulee but it is very good.  Its not overpowering or weak.  Its perfect!	0	0
1	B001RVFERK	A11VK79G41FSU6	"We'll never go back to ""baked""!"	These beat baked chips hands down! I love the crunch almost as much as I love the calorie content and the single serve bags! Because they are not fried you are saving fat and calories but they are not flat and tasteless like the baked chips either. You know the ones that if you bite off a piece the wrong way you can pierce your tongue with it? Never again! The BBQ is a tad strong IMHO but they are still keepers! The original flavor is awesome.	5	1

1	B007TJGZ5E	A1WDDZTSP0F3KE	The best non-flavored, Medium Roast KCup coffee	Don't be hesitant to try this coffee because of the name. I was looking for a good MEDIUM ROAST-NON FLAVORED kcup and this is it. Just right for an everyday cup of coffee. No bitterness, and low acidity. Perfect coffee for adding your flavored liquid creamer. The brewed color/strenght is just like a regular pot of Community Coffee or Folgers.	0	0
-1	B0016B7Z32	A5CR6GP49HVEE	Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me	I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.	2	0

-1	B003MP16A8	A3H7NPNDMGLOU4	I Like These Bars But They Don't Like Me	I love the taste and texture of these bars; they're sweet, but not overly-sweet and have a satisfying, nutty crunch and just enough chocolate to make them interesting.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, I apparently have a severe negative reaction to the artificial sweetener, maltitol, used in the chocolate coating.  About an hour and a half after eating one, my abdomen puffs up like a balloon filled with air, resulting in a very sore, achy feeling tummy and (excuse me) painful gas that lasts about three hours.<br /><br />Many people have this reaction to maltitol; if you're one of them, you'll have to learn, as I painfully have, to avoid anything that contains this sweetener.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company can make some maltitol-free versions of these bars in the future.	0	0
1	B000EDDSE8	AEDINQJSTH1KQ	I didn't know flax meal was this good!	My daughter started making flax bread a couple of weeks ago, and has raved and raved about it. She tells me how she puts savory seasonings in some(basil, oregano, sometimes cumin), and cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger in other batches. I had my doubts, but decided to give it a try. What do you know - it's crazy good, especially when you leave off the salt, or just put in a pinch. I don't even put sweetener in mine. Makes a yummy low-carb sandwich!	0	0

I try to keep my life 'decaffeinated' when possible and usually decaf tea is very watery and weak.  Trust me, you will be pleasantly surprised by the strength and flavor of this tea!  Dark colored, full bodied and won't keep you up at night!!  It's the ONLY tea this Grandma drinks!!  Enjoy!	0	0

I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!	12	0
1	B008RWUHA6	A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ	My wife loves these too.	My wife is trying to eat ultra-healthy, so I ordered these as a treat for her.  I'd already gotten her the blueberry one, which she liked, so I tried these.  She loves them.  The package size is convenient for her to take to work.  She works 12 hour days at the hospital, so having some quick energy food helps get her through the long day.They make her happy, and that makes me happy.	0	0
-1	B007M832YY	A2ZMMQ4W17EK2N	Original PopChips	Bought the Original flavor from the store and just tried them tonight. They were very greasy and salty. I did not like them a lot. I will not purchase this original flavor again. However I can't complain because I got the 3 ounce bag for only $1.00 at the store while they were on sale. I tried the BBq flavor and they are delicious. I bought the sea salt & vinegar, and cheddar but haven't tried those yet.	0	1

-1	B001GVIS4M	A36H7LJV90U2WU	It did not work for me at all...	I've been making yogurt for a few months with much success. So I am not new to this...<br /><br />I normally make yogurt with a previous batch, but I came across this product and saw the awesome reviews. I thought I could perhaps get better results with this starter, so I purchased two boxes. I followed the direction to heat the milk up to 180F and cooled it to 73-77F. I thought cooling the milk to 73-77F was strange as I've always cooled it to about 105F before adding previous bacteria culture into warmed milk. Most of the recipes I have seen online required the milk to cool to 105F as well, so I was a little bit confused. But then I thought the Yogourmet culture was special and therefore has a different temperature requirement.<br /><br />Well, I have an awesome thermos that always keeps the temperature for a prolonged period. I put the milk with Yogourmet mixture at 75F and set it aside for 14 hours (instruction said between 12-15 hours). As soon as I woke up in the morning, I excitedly opened my thermos. I discovered nothing but milk. There was no whey, firmed yogurt, nothing. It was literally how I left it.<br /><br />It seems like I am the only person who has had no luck with this culture. I am sure this company is great and the culture works normally as I can see from the previous reviews. I might have gotten a bad culture pack because it really did nothing for me. I am definitely not a beginner so I know I didn't make any mistakes in following the direction. I will email the company and see what can be done.	2	2
1	B004TPKAN4	A2KMY4RVMJ1EP6	They're gingery and they're snappy, they must be ginger snaps!	Newman's Own and I have had a really good relationship thus far; I have at least liked, and most usually loved, every product I have tried from them. Their organic ginger snaps are no exception. The cookies are relatively small (somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), but they are filled to the brim with gingery goodness, which you would hope for in a ginger snap. I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!<br /><br />As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices). The ingredients in order: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (ginger, sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium, phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that. If you're unfamiliar with the Newman's Own brand, it was co-founded by Paul Newman as a company where all profits from their food items go to various charities after taxes. It's a great cause that has fantastic, healthy, and quality products that while may be a bit pricier than other brands, won't break the bank.<br /><br />A little note, you might want to have a glass of milk, or cup of tea or coffee hanging around, because these ginger snaps really do snap back!	0	0
1	B003VXHGPK	A15281ZG5VT4GA	Great mild cup of coffee	"My favorite K-Cup so far. Absolutely NO aftertaste, which in my book is a huge plus. It's not acidic, not bitter, just a great MILD cup of coffee, which is exactly what it purports to be! I wish other people would read the description before they give a bad review based on their own stupidity. Don't buy a MEDIUM roast coffee and complain because it's not bold! Also, as a general rule the ones with ""Breakfast"" in the name are milder. I don't care for bold, dark roast, slap you awake coffee so I wouldn't buy a bold coffee and then complain that it was bold."	3	0
1	B000WVY4PE	A35BZKQ8J4JVV0	some things don't calm down	Needed a sleep aid, The reviews amazed me so I ordered some.  Brought it back with me from the states to Costa Rica.  Finally opened it up, tried it before bedtime, went easy on the quantity due to reviewers suggestions.  Next morning, I did feel like I slept well enough, but the bowels were very active.  So be very easy on the tiny spoonful of it is all I can say.  It takes a lot for me to have loose bowels.  This is like a natural laxative.  I don't use it every night though.  Don't want to worry I need to stay home to be near the toilet.	0	0

1	B0029PDW9A	A14MQ40CCU8B13	Could work for other uses	"I purchased an Axion 7"" TV & wanted some protection for the unit when in storage or travel. Working great distances from home, I choose to pack a little house & stay near the jobsite. To kill time, I like to watch TV. I've had only a couple of them due to my insistence on buying good quality units. To assure these units I purchase last, I buy the protective covers that also act as a storage for the accommodating accessories too. That way there is less chance of equipment loss. How many times have I ran across a cord or a plug that I asked: ""where did this go to?"". Only to find the answer a few weeks later, after I've thrown it away.<br /><br />I'd say this denim case could be used for the small note books or Acer mini laptop. It is a stiff case & offers some protection. I wouldn't give it the Samsonite test however."	0	0
1	B004JRMG98	A3F3B1JPACN215	Nice flavor with some heat	I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the Jalapeno Sauce.  It is kind-of like a spicy mayonnaise.  I used this sauce in tuna salad, on sandwiches and as a salad dressing.<br /><br />Similar to mayo, almost all of the calories come from fat.  I think it is tastier than mayo and has a nice amount of spice.  You can taste the pepper in the sauce but it doesn't leave your mouth burning.  It's a good balance of flavors.<br /><br />Even if you're not a big Taco Bell fan, this sauce is actually pretty good.	0	1

1	B0009YUEG2	A29BRRQNUMZYD5	Natural Cat litter---I feel green	One of the reasons I love pine litter is because it is just a natural product.  You can flush, put in yard or throw away and not feel guilty.  I hate all the fake scented cat litter.  Feline Pine just smells like pine.  After you scoop, you can mix up the litter in the box and it will dry.  You just add a little more into the box and it's good to go.  Very rare that the cats drag the pine pellets out of the box.  If some get out, you can just pick them up off the floor and put right back into the box. The pellets are large enough to handle.  I have three cats using one large box and it works out fine. I think it's a great product and the only litter I will use for my cats. In the summer months I scoop out the box and dump the litter in the yard near the pine trees. That's a great feeling!

1	B007ZI1V0S	A1DTK26PJROKIZ	excellent loose tea	I had never heard of Yellow Label. I was looking for Lipton Loose Leaf, which is difficult to find in markets. Ordered this from (fulfilled by) Amazon to check it out. It is a 'gunpowder' style and tastes better than regular Lipton Loose. A smaller gunpowder than you find in gourmet tea stores, but an excellent tea at a reasonable price.	7	0

-1	B0028PL7AM	ATF9GIT9E3X5S	Unpleasant to say the least	I drink a lot of iced tea but not if it isn't sweet.  I thought these individual packets would be good for adding to my tea and I'm glad to have something that won't spike my insulin levels.  One packet is worth about two sugar packets so be careful how much you use.  I think sugar tastes good, aspartame tastes good, sucralose (e.g. Splenda) tastes good, saccharin tastes good (when you don't overdo it) but this was just weird.  It was sweet for sure, but it seems like most of the sweetness didn't register until a few seconds later.  I also registered an almost bitter taste, but just for a split second with each sip.  It's really hard for me to explain, but I'll just say I had no desire to finish the rest of my iced tea.<br /><br />I tried it again later and did a few experiments with it.  First, I poured a little on my finger and tasted it by itself.  Again I thought it had kind of an odd taste and slightly bitter.  I poured a slightly larger portion on my finger and tasted that.  Yuck!  Maybe it's like that because it's sweeter than sugar, but I got the same sensation when I mixed it in my tea.  I also tried adding it gradually to my tea and the best I could do was a neutral flavor.  Once it started to get sweet I could taste that same funny and slightly bitter taste.  Another wasted glass.<br /><br />This is the first stevia product I've tried so I can't say the sweetener itself tastes like this, they do add other ingredients.  If you want to try this product you really need to get the cheapest/smallest that you can.  I'll be throwing out about 95% of this stuff and I'm regretting that I ever used 5% of it.<br /><br />I would, however, recommend agave nectar.  It's a low-calorie sweetener with a low glycemic index and it's natural (usually organic).  It has a smooth taste, a pleasant aftertaste [if any], and even when I use too much it doesn't taste terrible.  I've tried two different brands and I have yet to be disappointed.	2	2

1	B000MGOZEO	AQDKKTFH5XREM	Good for on the go, even though you will pay for the packaging.	I brought some of these packets with me today so that I could sweeten my tea at work and realized that I made too much coffee for the amount of Xylitol that I had originally put into it before I took off for my commute.<br /><br />The packaging has to be 'special' because Xlyitol is pretty 'humid', in that regular paper packaging would not be optimal.<br /><br />I write this because, although it's perfect for on the go, and the packaging is pretty much 'unavoidable' in regards to properly storing and transporting it, it was a pain in the butt to open one to two packets whilst driving (I had to wait for the next stoplight or I would've veered off of the road in my struggle to open the dang things!).<br /><br />All-in-all a great product. Even after having a 'sweetened' cup of coffee, I don't have a 'fuzzy' mouth, like sugar would normally do!	2	1

1	B002Y2QT2K	AO09RWV40IX78	CHICORY IS NOT COFFEE, PLEASE READ.	I placed an order for three Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground Coffee, Medium-Dark Roast, 100% Chicory, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6), thinking it was coffee. When I first looked at the product description it said 100% coffee. But it's 100% chicory and I called Amazon to clarify their description. I like the taste of chicory blended into my coffee. I use half a table spoon for every three spoons of coffee. It has a unique but pleasant flavor, but you can't drink it straight. I am not blaming Amazon and giving it five stars because it is what it is, chicory that is a good buy and helps flavor my coffee. If your a chicory fan then this review is useless. But if you are like myself, remember this is not coffee.<br />I hope you find my review helpful.	2	0
1	B00315WGNK	A10851U0FJXRAX	Excellent jerky! Great flavor & texture. My South Beach Phase 2 snack of choice!!	Solid strips of flavorful beef, slightly tenderized with natural papaya enzymes, gives this jerky a nice bite without stressing out your jaw muscles. Pleasant natural smoke and pepper flavor doesn't overwhelm like so many other brands - the beef flavor comes through. Very low fat (0.5 g) and carb (1 g)per 1 oz serving make this jerky my South Beach Phase 2 snack of choice. Great for an on-the-go protein fix. BTW - 1 oz is a substantial portion to snack on!!!	1	0

1	B001NZVW80	A3318V6FJ2KIII	My dog enjoys it and it helps her hips.	My dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a 6-month old puppy.  The vet said it was the worst case he'd seen in a puppy her age and we were told that she wouldn't be able to walk by the time she was three if we didn't have an expensive surgery done.  I've tried various supplements and foods over the years and although she may sway a bit when walking and tire easily she's now 8 years old and we frequently go on short hikes together.<br /><br />I started feeding her Happy Hips about 4 months ago.  Since that time I've cut out any other supplements and paid close attention to how she does.  She readily eats the food and doesn't gorge herself when eating.  She seems to have more energy and stamina now.  I don't want to push her too hard but last weekend I took her on a 4 mile hike over aggressive terrain, much more than we normally do, she led the pack the whole way and even jumped in the truck quickly when we were done.  In the past I've had to lift her into the truck at the end of any hikes.  She spent the rest of the day sleeping but the next day was up and going again.  Overall I'm very impressed with my dog's health and since this has been her food over the last several months it has to be a factor in how she's doing.  I originally was going to rate this 4 stars but really have not complaints at all and my pup is doing great so I upped it to 5 stars.<br /><br />As a side note I read reviews online before feeding my dog this food and found that it is rated well by a few independent review sites.	0	0
1	B007RTR9FQ	AZD8SMNGQI98O	A good volumizing shampoo	The product is good but it left my hair a bit fuzzy, more volume than I really wanted. So I cut the amount I used and it was better.

-1	B007IEFJ0M	A1WG5SD91EWYXZ	ok but more salty than chicken flavor	I was expecting a paste type of broth mix but this is a fluffier dry mix.  It has MSG if you care about that.  I think it will work well as a salt substitute where you want a chicken flavor but too salty as a direct replacement for chicken bullion.  I would compare this to the broth you get in the chicken noodle soup packets or the chicken Ramen envelopes.	0	0
1	B004HOLD92	AOFVZT5XYRBFY	Full of flavor	To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.	0	0

-1	B001EO5X80	AW2DKYDNTRIHN	The expiration date is ten months ago	The matzohs seemed to have shrunk a bit, and were curved instead of flat. So I looked at the expiration date on the boxes, and they'd expired in March 2010. This is January, 2011.<br /><br />I've never had amazon ship me an item that was past its expiration date before, so I hadn't expected it. Not very nice, considering that I paid full price.<br /><br />The expiration date on matzohs is usually two years or longer, so these are at least three years old.<br /><br />Another example of caveat emptor.<br /><br />Before I order a product, I'd like to know if it is already past its expiration date. Is there a way that I can do that?	1	0

Don't get me wrong, most of what I consume would be considered ""gourmet"", but I was simply disappointed by this product.  I don't get a richness of flavor depth (similar to Hershey), I don't get a natural cocoa flavor...I simply get a raw sweetness from this ""sauce"".<br /><br />To summarize:  it's fine, very drinkable, and does the intended purpose.  I personally don't feel it's a gourmet product at all, however.  I see from reviews I am nearly alone in that sentiment!"	1	1
1	B001EQ53H4	A3VZVYWCTGIEV0	classic	Gold Coast is one of the most bold of the Starbucks Coffee. You can take deep mouth fulls of this. Has a slightly bitter flavor and extremely large mouth feel. Spicy, woody, impressive.<br /><br />Still, every coffee the mermaid makes is well balanced, and this is no exception. Less adventurous drinkers can add lots of milk or cream to this and still get a bold cup.<br /><br />It won't take the paint off the walls--unless you come over and let me make it.	0	0
1	B004YGQPAK	A1OMXVXXP07F05	Great taste, but didn't do much for energy.	All in all, this isn't a bad product.  Each pack comes with 9 pieces, so in order to get the 100% of B6, B12 and Vitamin C you need to eat 3.  Which means you would run out in 3 days if you do 3 a day.  Another note is that each piece has 20 calories and 5 grams of sugar, so it will cost you 60 calories to get 100% of the aforementioned vitamins.<br /><br />I tried one before a 40 minute workout and didn't really notice much. I also tried one after a workout and it didn't give me much of a boost.  So, from that front, I can't say it really gave me an energy boost.<br /><br />I will say however, the product tastes wonderful!  The best part is when you get close to the honey center and bite into the candy, the honey slowly oozes into your mouth and on your tongue for a taste sensation that is very, very pleasant.	0	0

-1	B004R8L71W	A2H2I5FY1PUHP1	Mediocre Marketing Gimmick	"I'm not a believer in ""sneaking vegetables past the children,"" especially when the veg in question is in the form of pasta. While there may technically be cauliflower in it, it has none of the health benefits of eating actual cauliflower. There is also less in a package than original mac and cheese, and only two servings rather than three. Even if the cost per package is the same, that makes this product more expensive per serving.<br /><br />Cooking the very thin pasta for the six minutes directed on the package resulted in pasta well past the al dente stage. I used butter rather than margarine in the preparation but otherwise made as directed with no added ingredients. We got two decent sized servings from the box. The resulting mixture was just o.k. For me, the pasta had no texture and little taste, only a mild cheese flavor. Mrs. Boilermate said she could taste the veg in the pasta and said she thought it was a ""good addition."" She thought it was less creamy than ""Easy Mac"" or the regular variety. She said Stouffers Mac and Cheese was better, and I agree with her.<br /><br />Overall there's not enough here for me to like enough to purchase this product. You get less per package than the regular variety in exchange for a ""veggie benefit"" that's a bit over-hyped. And, if Mrs. B. is to believed, one that doesn't taste as good."	0	0

-1	B001RVFDOO	A2RL1RS6PWUHWI	Too strong of flavors	I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.	2	0

-1	B003SBRNKI	A2T0V99GLGXWCM	Not quite the same as what you get in stores	"Packaging looks exactly the same as what you buy in stores, but the contents, strangely, are not quite the same. Store-bought salmon cans contain solid chunk(s) of fish covered with a little bit of semitransparent liquid. This thing here otoh, is not solid fish, but more like broken-up mish-mash in a larger amount of rusty looking, smelly liquid. I didn't quite like it and still prefer the store-bought version, even though it's a tad more expensive. I can frequently get this thing on sale though, where it's even cheaper than this online offering. Otoh, perhaps it's this particular shipment that was defective. I'll try again and update this review. As of right now it's three stars: useable, but noticeably inferior to the same product obtained in a physical grocery store (I can't begin to guess what this difference might be due to).<br /><br />PS. Btw. I bought this for eleven-forty-eight w/ free shipping (I begin to mention prices 'cause I see mind-blowing overnight price increases on many products. Like this one now is twenty-four, DOUBLE what it was  less than two months ago -- is it nuts of what?) Please do the same and mention specific numbers in your reviews. Never assume tht just because you buy online you get a good price: surely this thing doesn't cost six bucks a pop at a store? Three-thirty-five in my ""favourite neighborhood"" establishment.

-1	B000OMHFDE	A1E1YGK6JZ4MEG	I would not recommend...	I strongly urge you to reconsider purchasing this item. I am have purchased a few different items from this particular seller that have been wonderful. I started to get nervous of the extra calories I was consuming in the regular matcha green tea powder so I purchased this item. It did taste fine, however, about an hour after consuming a cup I had horrible diarrhea. Each time I consumed any of this item the same thing happened. After some research I found that the sweetener used, xylitol, has this effect on many people. I never really get sick like that from anything so it's not like I was susceptible or anything. I stupidly bought a 5 pound bag too which I had to throw away. Buyer beware!	0	0

1	B00119Q3EQ	A2WLNSZ9U0T1S3	The BEST Dirty Martini mix - aside from actual olive brine!	I have been using this stuff for a long long time, and I don't seem to ever get tired of the taste.  I love my dirty martini's on weekends, especially in the winter time.  :-) - I was buying them locally forever and it never occurred to me that I should check Amazon...of course it was 15% cheaper to begin with and there was a 15% off coupon....voila.  I bought a 4 pack at sight and the rest is history.<br /><br />This taste great with a perfect mix/balance of olive taste and saltiness to make the Martini taste perfectly dirty.  You can use olive brine, but its wasting a jar of olives every time...no point.<br /><br />Get some and try it...you will not be disappointed.	2	0

When my local Natual Foods COOP failed financially last year I was lost in this rural community without many of the foods that had become a part of our daily life.  Twisted fruit is family favorite and Amazon is my favorite suppler.  This is a healthy pocket food for my teenager and a stuffer for my elementry son's lunches.	0	0
1	B000FPKX3E	AHCT2ZFJX1FN0	Great to have on hand	Since my daughter is 14 months old she pretty much eats what I prepared for meals, however sometimes I don't think what I have made is something she should eat such as steak (too hard to chew).  So I like to have these available for a quick meal to prepare for my daughter.  She likes the taste, simple to prepare, and you have meat and vegetables all in one meal.	0	0

1	B00271NNLI	A1MYW6G0G2NFTW	A Fantastic Cuppa Joe!	I think I may have tried just about every major brand of pod coffee available.  Some are good, some just OK, and some can only be described as bilge water.  I've wanted to try the Melitta One brand for quite some time, but they never seemed to be in stock.  When I finally was able, I gave Buzzworthy a try, and I have to say, I'm not disappointed in the least.  This particular roast is strong, aromatic, heady and a real pleasure to the palate.  Being a fuller pod, it fits much better in the double pod holder - don't forget to wet the bottom of the pod before pushing it firmly into the holder.  This seems to do the trick, with consistent, dark, rich cups of coffee being rewarded each time.  I feel this coffee is at least as high a quality and flavorful as Wolfgang Puck's strongest brews, so give Melitta a try if you like Puck's product (I do). Buzzworthy is a much more cost effective cuppa Joe without sacrificing anything in the taste or caffeine department.	9	0
1	B004728MI4	AJQD2WWJYOYFQ	Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!	Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.	0	0

1	B000SATIZA	A11V7W73DYY0A	Will forever occupy a spot in my refrigerator!	"I bought this tea not just for the health benefits, but because I'm a fan of red teas, period. I always keep a 1 gallon jug in the fridge for both iced tea and to ""nuke"" for hot tea. The color is lovely and the taste is heavenly. It doesn't require a lot of sweetening, but I've used both sucralose and stevia and both taste fine (as well as sugar-free raspberry syrup - YUM!). And yes, my very inconsistent blood pressure went down from the 125-130 systolic range down to 115. Pretty amazing stuff, highly recommended."	4	0
1	B000FBKFV8	A24UBSSLPNU0SG	Absolutely Wonderful!	These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.	0	0

Scent falls flat<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (.5) - Does not taste like anything other than normal tea.<br />++Iced (1) - again no flavor is present aside from just tea to me<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (1.5)- Adding the sweetener (.5 pkg of truvia) usually makes flavors stick out, and until I added the sweetener I didn't detect anything other than just black tea.<br />++Iced (2) -  So Iced with sweetener is the only way I find this tea to be enjoyable.<br /><br />2nd Steep (2) it maintains its flavor through a second steep but I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />Summary -  I really wanted to like this tea but it just didn't do it for me. The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) ""steep"" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain Lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).<br /><br />*** I have spoken with the seller who has assured me the tea is not old. You cant make everyone happy flavor wise and this was just not for my palette, I have a feeling it may be due to tea having no sweetener added and I prefer a sweetness to my tea. I am very pleased with the professionalism of the seller  and I will be giving them the full rating."	0	0

It is exactly what the reviews claim it to be.  The product quality is highly tasteful and nutritious.  My favorite part is the pulp- if you like pulp. I love pulp so it was very tasty.  I introduced this particular product to my family and they also loved it.  They made very positive comments about the nutritional content as well.  The amount of potassium is amazing, worth 2.5 bananas and sugar content is looooowwr than other very tasty cocunut waters.  You have to get this if you like coconut water, like the texture of pulp, and want something different to add to your intake of liquids that is good for you.

I've bought her rawhide from various places online and in stores, but haven't, until recently, had any problems with her not wanting to eat them.  These rawhide look very good. They are clean, smooth, and a good size.  I've given her multiple chips because she'll eat one, and not the other. I kept trying because she would eat one, and seemed happy with it; then the next day, she would put it down and walk away.<br />Bottom line, I believe this to be a good product and a great value for the money. Just not sure if the issue is with the rawhide itself, or my dog's changing preferences. She didn't like the bag of rawhide I bought right before this one either.	0	0

-1	B005VOOM4A	AUITG1DJ3QUGK	A Good company, but the coffee is a disappointment	"I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0"">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW"">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good."	5	3

I think it took a detour through a waste dump before ending up in my mailbox.<br />I have had Lapsang Souchong at Pete's Coffee & Tea  and was very impressed by the smokey flavor. So I tried it from other blenders and most often liked it (Twinning's bagged version of the tea isn't bad, but it's like listening to an opera by echo). I took a chance on this brand and really wish I wouldn't have; this has got to be the worst flavored Lapsang Souchong I have ever had. The flavor of the tea is as if it was smoked over construction waste and rotten wood. I've tried 8 cups of it so far using different steeping times and water temperatures and am continually disappointed.

I don't know when they changed the tea to include 'Natural and Artificial' flavors, but the taste of the tea I got in July has totally changed for the worse, and I can't drink it! The only way I can describe the way it tastes is that it reminds me of burnt wiring. I opened up a second box (of the six) and tried one of tea bags in that box, and it's the same thing: it's undrinkable.<br /><br />I am really bummed out, because it was my favorite tea. Unfortunately, it can't be returned, so I've got boxes of the tea that I can't drink.<br /><br />I may try a box of the Organic Caffeine-Free version, but from the reviews it doesn't sound like it's got as much flavor as the Original blend.	2	0

We're using our Keurig more now because of the drawer.  The Keurig fits on top of the drawer under cabinet when not in use.  However, we have to pull the Keurig out from under the cabinet to put in/take out the K-cup.	0	0

1	B002TMV34E	A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z	Makes a darn good cup of joe.*	"Classique Supreme is the second of the Melitta Gourmet Coffee Cafe Collection coffees I've tried. (I received free samples for review of the Classique Supreme and the Hazlenut Creme Brulee.) And I am quite pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My coffee of choice to date, which I've been drinking for around 2 decades, is Peet's (which I get shipped to me as there are no Peet's outlets near me). Peet's sells several varieties which I like, and I always buy whole beans and grind them to make a cup at a time via a cone filter. When making coffee for 2 or 3 people I make each cup separately (using 2 or 3 cone filters at once). Also, I never drink straight coffee but always sweeten it (usually with honey) and add half & half (and sometimes French Vanilla International Delight).<br /><br />Melitta's Classique Supreme, as well as the Hazelnut Creme Brulee in the same line (and I assume all the varieties in their Cafe Collection line) are ground ""Extra Fine,"" and look to me to be finely ground enough to be used in an espresso maker (though I only make espresso - which I use in homemade lattes - with unflavored dark roasted coffees and the Classique Supreme is a medium roast). It looks and feels too finely ground to be used in a French Press (which I occasionally use for preparing coffee made from freshly ground beans, ground relatively coarse).<br /><br />So for testing/sampling purposes, I've been preparing the Classique Supreme (which I've drank several cups of over a couple of days) in a filter cone, using the exact measurements I use when preparing ground Peet's beans. And once I have sweetened and creamed the coffee to my taste, I cannot detect a difference in quality. The only difference I have noticed is that both varieties of Melitta's Cafe Collection that I've sampled leave me with less of an intense caffeine buzz than I typically get from the same size cup of Peet's (whether it's a medium or dark roast variety of Peet's). That's not necessarily a bad thing, for sometimes my second cup of coffee of the day (I usually drink 2 TALL cups a day) leaves me feeling a bit over-caffeinated (e.g., headachey or just off-kilter).<br /><br />The bottom line is that I like this coffee and given the relatively low price (e.g., at Amazon as well as Melitta's website), I'm motivated to try other varieties in Melitta's Cafe Collection line (particularly their darker roasts).<br /><br />I had difficulty opening both 11 oz. sample bags of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee I received - I found it impossible to open either bag without tearing holes in the upper half of each bag - so I called Melitta to comment about this. The customer service representative I spoke with said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top of the bag.<br /><br />*(The phrase ""cup of joe"" supposedly came into vogue after Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson, Josephus Daniels, banned alcohol aboard navy vessels in 1914, leaving coffee the strongest drink on navy ships.)"	0	0
1	B0012DM8ZY	A2KCD2PFUDXPPX	Not too salty, good taste	"I also grew up in Pa. and had Snyder's regularly. For those who aren't familiar, I particularly like this brand because they taste less salty, but have a good taste.

1	B001SATWUA	A2C5Z6F97S4X82	Good price.  Good Coffee	Speculators have driven coffee up the past year.  A 34 oz can of Columbian, 100% Arabica (the good stuff) is at least $11.  You rarely see coffee sold in one pound packages anymore (12 oz is the norm).  With Subscribe and Save and the promo Amazon was running, I got 10 packs for $3.80 a pound.  I can now drink my precious Joe without a guilty conscience.	1	0
-1	B000XY08PK	A3E7S1TSF67T3U	Do not be fooled by the Picture	Naturally I did not expect the tree I bought to look exactly like the image, trees are natural and no two trees look alike. What is very deceptive is the size. The image is a horrible representation of what you actually receive. The tree and base in the image are much larger than what I received. The foliage achieved on the tree in the image is 2 to 3 times what you get. My tree is the size of a large piece of broccoli, with a small crown, it stands no more than 2 inches high. That is a generous measurement. It had no branches on it longer than it was high. I am a realist, however the image they provide is of a much older larger tree.	0	1
1	B001F3DZYO	AJKK9F9P1FVVV	So great I ordered more as soon as I tasted them.	These peaches are extraordinarily delicious.<br />I was apprehensive ordering the first time from a then unknown source to me.<br />However Trader Joe's, my here-to-fore resource, is unable to stock dried peaches so I was left to try Amazon.<br />So glad I did.  I'll never go back to Trader Joe's unless I have to.<br />I much prefer yellow peaches, which these are, instead of white ones which was all Trader Joe's ever carried.<br />The yellow is more nutritious according to my nutrition books.<br />I opened the 10 lb. package yesterday and today I repeated the order.<br />I figured I'd better get them while the getting was good.	0	0

-1	B0029NVJ4M	AGF53TM0RAV1N	Cat's are fickel	My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.	1	1
1	B000CMHMFM	A3JV41WP2W5628	Good nutrition and great taste	Genisoy bars are fantastic.  I started eating them years ago for extra protein as I recovered from a major surgery.  I had tried many different protein bars, and genisoy bars were the inky palatable option back then.  Today there are even more protein bar options out there, but genisoy products still top my list.  These bars taste great,  Genisoy bars do not taste like something from a chemical lab or something formed from swept up woodshop floor material, nor do they taste like bad candy.  They have a good mouthfeel and excellent flavor.  If you are looking for a nutrition/protein bar that dos not make you feel that you are being punished by eating it, these are for you.	1	1
-1	B0018CFQLC	ATPLVKHJVJ401	Two Sick Cats within minutes of eating.	We having been feeding our two young cats the chicken formula for a while now and they seem to be able to keep it down with little problem. Natures variety touts rotational feeding as a one of the perks of the brand so we tried out this formula. even after adding a small amount in with the chicken the cats become sick with a few minutes and vomit out what they had eaten. Eating it alone without the chicken formula with it produced worse results. Just to make sure I fed them their usually raw food at night and they were fine, but the serving of rabbit dry in the morning resulted in nearly instant vomiting.<br /><br />I hope a company like this reads the various review sites and can balance this formula out.	0	0

When I was a kid, getting hold of a ""dubbel-Dajm"" was considered very cool indeed.<br /><br />Daim is VERY tasty, but constantly get stuck between my teeth, and at other impossible places! LOL.

1	B005CV7W7G	A3PFA5SJOI9DN4	Oreos are the best!	I love Oreos. Oreos are my all time favorite snack. There is not one time in my life that someone has asked me if I wanted an Oreo and I said no. It's too bad that I can't have milk , cause Oreos and milk are the best!<br /><br />  What I like about Oreos, is that they come with several oreo , they're not expensive. You never get tired of them. Everyone likes them , and since everyone likes them, they're great to have at a party or any special occasion.<br /><br />  My complaint is that they always get stuck in my braces, and the white cream in the middle comes off real easy.<br /><br />  Oreos are in a round shape. The outside of the cookie is black and it says Oreo in the middle. The middle has a thick white cream. if you put your finger and thumb in a round shape that is about how big they are.<br /><br />  Me and my friend go to the store and buy them when we have money. The Oreos are always good when there from store it seems like. I have had Oreos other times too.<br /><br />  I think that this product is good for just about anyone. I have never met anyone who does not like Oreos. If you don't like sweets then I don't think you would like this product that much. If you don't like chocolate then you probably won't like it either, cause the outside of the cookie tastes like chocolate.	0	0
1	B003D1YB62	A2A1XYSB692L6J	T E M P T I N G........T__O__O........T E M P T I N G...	"..............................U P D A T E...........................<br /><br />TASTE AND QUALITY OF PRODUCT.....5 stars<br />BARGAIN RATING...................0 STARS<br /><br />.<br />.<br />"" W I D A "".........RECENTLY, I bought myself one small bag of (other) potato chips, and one THREE MUSKETTEERS Bar.  I love both of these snacks a LOT, but I wanted to see which I liked best.  The potato chips won, (by a nose) -- and so I must come to the conclusion that potato chips, for good or ill, are my VERY favourite snack, and, (as I think I mention below), I have yet to meet a potato chip I do not like to eat!<br /><br />Also, as mentioned below, these particular potato chips are ESPECIALLY tempting to me, because the gracious living of the Old South, (and also in todays New South, in New England, Old England, India, Sweden, Canada, and wherever kind and hospitable people can be found...which is all over the world), is warming and comforting to me, reminding me that there are STILL outposts of civilzed behaviour, (and manners), all over the world -- and these potato chips, purporting to be of a ""Carolina BBQ variety"", happily remind me of this.  (I am also ""turned off"", (mightily), by the sad, recent trend amongst many people, (also unhappily all over the world), who take a ""who cares?"" attitude, are NOT gracious and do NOT have any<br />manners whatsoever.  Etiquette, (as Letitia Baldridge, former social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, has said), is the art and practice of making OTHER people feel comfortable, and there is NOTHING ""stuffy"" about it.  Too many people today forget this -- and grab, and gab in 4-letter-word language, and stab, by telling dirty, (and worse) ""jokes"" -- and it is a truly sad when people mistake manners for inflexible social stratification, while proceeding, (seemingly of their own free will), to slide down a few levels in civilzed behaviour, taking those with whom they come in contact -- if they are not aware, and prepared to do battle with such attitudes -- sadly along with them.  (II say ""SEEMINGLY of their own free will"", because I know that the unconscious, deadly influence of the mass media has SOMETHING to do with this slide downhill, by so many.  Or at least, some images portrayed by the media intensify this slide.....)<br /><br />At any rate, in my quest for ANY outposts of civilized behaviour, today, the lure of LAY'S TANGY CAROLINA BBQ POTATO CHIPS proved irresistable.  The hot weather often found in the Southern US can bring out the worst -- but also, the best -- in people, and, ever the optimist, I just could NOT pass up this chance to have a real ""taste"" of a sample of what I hoped to be the best the Southern US has to offer.<br /><br />In my main review, below, I mentioned I was NOT going to buy these potato chips because the seller did NOT mention how many bags would arrive.  But, upon taking a second look, I noticed that each bag would weigh a total of 10.5 ounces, and the entire package would weigh 3 pounds.  This would seemingly make for 3...or perhaps 4 bags of potato chips, with the extra weight given for the packaging.  Slightly more expensive than potato chips in the supermarket -- but not by much.  And besides, I had NEVER seen the ""Carolina BBQ"" style of Lay's potato chips in my local store.  These combined circumstances proved irresistable to me -- so I finally decided to buy one unit of these over-whelmingly tempting chips, and see what I could see, (and taste what I could taste.)<br /><br />Well, they arrived this morning.  In a US ""Priority"" Mail box, which presumably would take UP TO three pounds in weight.<br /><br />The box weighed far, far lighter than this.  It did not say ""Potato Chips"" on the outside, so I didn't know what was inside, until I opened the box.  Inside was ONE 10.5 ounce bag of potato chips.  Just ONE!  It was covered with stick-on bubble wrap, to protect the contents -- but also, I suspected, so that I could not easily duplicate my purchase, and send it back for a refund.  (The seller seems to know potato chip afficitionados well -- once we see the bag of p.c.s, it's hard not to open it!)<br /><br />The potato chips inside WERE quite good.  Somewhat like a ""light"" BBQ flavour, with just a small bit of barely-noticable extra sweetening for a different flavour.  But $18.95 (cost plus shipping), for a single bag of potato chips, (with the normal price marked as $3.98, there for me to notice only AFTER I had opened the bag)?  NEVER again!<br /><br />I could easily put all the blame here on a perhaps-far-too-greedy seller -- but, to be totally honest, I cannot.  I had sadly forgotten the fact that ANY seller can be contacted, before purchasing anything, through Amazon itself.  For those items NOT sold by Amazon, but through a third party, (as these potato chips were), all one need do is click on the seller's name, and see his or her ""store-front"" revealed.  This ""store-front"" page lists many things...including satisfaction ratings by customers -- AND A LINK TO CONTACT THE SELLER!  This link is sometimes difficult to find -- but it is ALWAYS there.  All I had to do, in this instance, was contact the seller, and inquire of him or her just HOW MANY bags of potato chips were actually contained in any one shipment.  I have contacted sellers before -- but totally forgot in this instance, for which I have only myself to blame.  Hopefully, though, this part of my review will help other buyers who have questions about products sold by third parties, to more easily ask questions of sellers. This said, (and my own inadequicy admitted), I still think that puting only ONE 10.5 ounce bag of potato chips into a carton stated to be of three pounds in weight, is a rather unsavoury selling tactic.  By my calculations, the seller here has made over a 300% profit -- at my expense.  (It would be a 600% profit, but I am not here counting shipping and handling charges.)<br /><br />I begin to wonder if the seller has some connections with the I.R.S.?  (Only kidding here, I.R.S.!) Yet I must admit, though the seller perhaps, should be taught the meaning of ""usury"", for his higher-than high profit on my purchase, I also must admit that I forgot the most rudimentary of buyer resources.  When In Doubt -- Ask.  Or -- W. I. D. A.!<br />.<br />.<br /><br />................O R I G I N A L.......R E V I E W...............<br /><br />...As a Northerner who yet yearns for the grace and polish of the Old South, (which can also be found, even today, anywhere civilized people comport themselves -- including, (in great numbers), people living the modern South, and hospitable places such as New England, Old England, India, Sweden and Canada, (but also, in smaller numbers, perhaps, in other places all over the world), and yet ever-mindful of the fact that the Confederate Anthemn, ""Dixie"", was actually written in Brooklyn, New York -- where I was born -- I, (being a potato chip affictionado in any event), obviously found the LAY'S TANGY CAROLINA BBQ FLAVOURED POTATO CHIPS -- 10.5 oz -- herein offered -- totally and absolutely irresistable.  Yet, I will resist (!)  Why?  The price given is $9.95.  Plus $8.95 shipping.  The NUMBER OF BAGS IS N_O_T GIVEN!  Will I then be paying close to $20.00 for 10.5 ounces, (one bag) of potato chips????  As the number of 10.5 ounce bags is, as I have mentioned, not included in the description, I very well could be doing just this, should I decide to buy.  For this reason, (and for this reason only), have I sadly decided not to. I have yet to meet a potato chip I do not like...and so I will chose another.  Maybe not as tasty, but tasty enough.  Any extra money I will save will go for ""the taste of freedom"", and my favourite political party!  PLEASE state the NUMBER of bags included in ordering these wonderful, southern-style potato-chips, in future!  Thank you!<br />Hopefully,"	1	1

1	B0041CIP3M	AA98O5326L88T	Hard to believe this is pre-packaged food, and my Chinese wife and Thai friend agree	"I was expecting this to be really salty, like most prepackaged food, but was pleasantly surprised. Albeit not as surprised as my wife (who grew up in Beijing and generally hates prepackaged food) or our friend from Bangkok! Along with the recommended beef, we added potatoes, veggies, sausage, and just a little sugar, and it tasted like homemade. Our friend didn't even realize that it was packaged food until we showed him the box -- he just assumed that my wife made it from scratch.<br /><br />Also, the small box made a pretty good amount of sauce. Often times with these kinds of things, one or two people can easily finish off a package that claims to have 6 or 8 servings so they can water down the ""nutrition"" information. Along with some rice, this made enough for three adults with one small serving left over.<br /><br />The only negative is the leaves -- there are a TON of them. I ended up chewing up and swallowing a lot of them just because it got to be a hassle picking around them. I would have preferred fewer, larger pieces. I wouldn't want to change the taste, though! It's a bit expensive, too, but considering how much food it makes (despite the small box), it's not too bad."	0	0

I didn't think to read the ingredients before buying, since it wasn't diet. Not sure why they did that, since the first ingredient is SUGAR. I can't give it a good rating, as I stay away from artificial sweeteners and I feel that they were a bit deceptive by not making the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners more noticeable. I don't drink cola every day (maybe once a week or less) and I feel that sugar is OK in moderation.	3	1

She has never been ill and is a very healthy dog - 19 years old.<br /><br />Look online and investigate this product via consumer affairs. The story is very common, some dogs even dying from GI tract infections, siezures and horrible allergies.<br /><br />We'll be switching her back to the old standby, SOJO's. She's kind of tired of it, but we know it is good for her and won't hurt her.	0	4

All you do is add some water into it and basically you choose the consistency. It tastes amazing and I couldn't be happier with it. I'm so glad i ran across this product!	0	0

1	B0018KLPFK	A1ZGKSWY5M9LTB	Surprisingly delicious	I've only had the Apple Pie version, but they are really tasty. It's moist and flavorful and contains only dates, almonds, UNSWEETENED apples, raisins, walnuts and cinnamon. This is an ingredients list I can be excited about. It's a quick, nutritious meal on the go and very nutrient dense, with good fats and almost no sodium at all.<br /><br />I will be ordering these in more flavors. Highly recommended.	2	0

They definitely stand behind their products and are very pleasant to deal with.  This jerky has a sweet barbeque flavor, and is quite tender and moist.  Very few pieces have a little gristle; for the most part they are easy to eat.  I agree they could have less salt for my taste, and also for health reasons, but they are quite delicious as they are.  This is the best jerky I have ever had.	2	0

-1	B007C63FBQ	A1WX80FIEONFPF	Great steaks -- Horrible delivery	I ordered 12 steaks but only six arrived.  I contacted Omaha and they said they would send six more.  When the six more arrived they were completely thawed and now I am afraid to eat them  -- maybe I will fry them up and give them to my dog -- he has a strong stomach.  The six that arrived on time and still frozen were delicious. If this were baseball I would be thrilled, but I am not happy batting .500 in the steak department.<br /><br />Update:  Omaha sent me 12 more steaks.  They arrived still frozen and the two I have eaten were delicious.<br /><br />So all told, I originally ordered 12 -- only six arrived -- six more were sent but were thawed -- but then they sent 12 and they were great.  So in the end I ordered 12, but got 18 great steaks.  Omaha made it more than right.  Omaha may not be good at counting but they get an A for effort.	0	0

-1	B000EQT574	AFBAML6LS05KB	If you want fiber, don't buy!	I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!	9	2

1	B0029NV488	A2W9B725TZBXOX	My fat cat....	spoiled little sensitive stomach shelter kittie, begs for these when the bag is first opened because the outside IS crunchy and theinside is creamy. He carefully studies his little cache of 3 or 4 and nibbles each one slowly, savoring w his eyes closed. He dropped one and with a petulant mew jumped down from his chair and went searching for it. He 'talks' to himself all the time, mewing and grunting if things are out whack...he couldnt find his little nibble so I pointed to it and he snatched it up like a greedy little thing. These treats are so loved and comforting, given along with Pet-Ease Paw Gel which I use for anxiety. This little guy was a litter runt and caged alone when I was at the shelter. These huge blue eyes and the worst smelling coast-he was sick and it seemed the vets had given up. He's a roly poly muscle bound little smarty pants now at 6 yrs and these treats keep his coat shiny and the paw gel keep him calm...if frustrated or bored he will shred paper or find some clear manner to show his upset.	2	0

-1	B003DA54HS	AQ5PNEIWJE7VP	DONT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT	My dog almost died from this product. The bone splinters and the company knows it. They have a liability statement on their product because I am sure I am not the first dog owner to have gone through the hell that I went through. I bought a smoked bone from the grocery store because I thought it was big looking, met the size required for my dog and I thought since it was American made it was a quality product. It is far less than quality. Would anyone give arsenic to their dog, absolutely not. So don't spend your money on this killer product. After 3,500 dollars in gastronomy surgery, emergency care,I spent a sad and scared Christmas tending to a poor puppy whining and whelping in pain from their defective junk. Please take this review to heart, I want to spare you what I went through.	7	1
-1	B0090X8IPM	A3W4D8XOGLWUN5	Vanilla Brew	There is no question about the fact that I absolutely love a rich and full-body flavored cup of coffee. The aroma can always get to me through a single whiff for me to enjoy. But when it does come to the best, you really expect to the best company to have the best flavor. That does come mostly well with Starbucks, and their brand of Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee. The taste does fell delightful, but honestly I was hoping from the smell that there could've been a lot more vanilla flavored into the coffee, making more savory cup deliver the best vanilla you could ask for. While it isn't a bad cup from Starbucks at all, I have definitely tasted better from brands like Melitta and Folgers. Still, I wish I could've gotten more Starbucks than my money had shown for it.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+	0	0

-1	B003VPGQV8	A1IJEK78GL54AE	Not as amazing as I anticipated	I was recommended this product by a relative of mine, but I must say I didn't feel it was as spectacular as she made it seem. It wasn't overtly chile-ey. Nor was it very Lime-ey. It was just... Meh. To be honest after all the years I've been seasoning my shrimp with some salt, pepper, chili powder & a squeeze of lime it just couldn't compare. I tried using it on some grilled chicken as well but found that, again, there wasn't anything special or really notable about the flavor that made it stand out. I yet again ended up switching back to what I was already using on my chicken- a jalapeno spice mix. I would probably have given this product 2 stars but considering my aunt recommended it I decided to offer 3 as a leeway for all those varying taste buds out there.	0	1

1	B0040WCQKQ	A2SNRIDC4QCCXN	I really like this - add some fresh veggies and ... YUM!	"There are many workdays when I only have a few minutes for lunch or (all too often) dinner. On these days, Dr. McDougall's products are lifesavers! I keep some fresh, washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes. Just microwave this one, for instance, while cutting up some broccoli, peppers, a carrot, and whatever else I have around (I also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day, cut in little ""twigs"" - delicous!) By the time you're through cutting, you'll have finished with cooking the soup. Take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water, add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl, toss the veggies in the liquid, and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds. When through, dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious, healthy meal. The men in my office come snigging around -- several are now also fans, despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan. When I am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in, I add a spring onion on top (I just use an office scissors to cut it.) If you can afford the calories, a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition, as well, as is tamari. YUMMY!"	0	0
1	B002KXY8VM	A1K7DQBGWZV0IP	Good n hot	"I have not been a fan of kettle style chips in the past, but for these I'll make an exception.  2-3 chips in and you've got a burn going on.  I have looked for a truly hot chip for some time, and most fall seriously short.  For those not ""appreciative"" of the heat level of these chips, they are overwhelmed with the hot, and say it covers up the taste.  Not for me!  Actually, I could use them somewhat hotter, but they are not a disappointment.  Good heat, great with beer."	0	0

-1	B003GTOIUU	A2BB4DGBRVGKWW	It's just another v_lveeta substance	Home style, just like grandma used to make, right?<br /><br />No.  The central substance of this product is a bag full of that gel-like cheese goo, just like the V brand.  Adding 2 tablespoons of butter and a little milk (as per the directions) does not change the end product much.  It also includes a tiny bag of white powder.  I am not sure what that is, but it doesn't help any either.<br /><br />The normal box of dry Mac and Cheese is better than this stuff.  If you want to improve upon the classic Mac and Cheese box, just make it as per the directions and then stir in 3/4 cup of shredded real cheese and about 1/4 cup of extra milk.  Then let it sit on the stove at low heat for about 5 or 10 minutes, and you've got that oven-baked cheesiness.	1	1

You get 6 Sno-Ball packages and they do not come in boxes other than the shipping carton. These could be purchased much cheaper from any local stop-and-go market or gas station.

Not sure if it was the product or her system but I can tell you that she eats fresh bananas, home cooked rice and Quinoa without a problem. We threw the rest of the Plum Tots products in the trash once we figured out what was happening. Haven't purchased a Plum Tots product since.	0	0
1	B005GRCWDU	A25BTF3HK5WJK2	Good, Mild Flavor, High Caffeine Coffee	"I consider myself a reasonable coffee enthusiast having done tours of places like Intelligentsia and know a decent bit about how to make the right brew.<br /><br />That said, Lavazza Crema e Gusto is an interesting 30% Arabica, 70% Robusto blend.  It's well known that Robusto beans have less flavor than Arabica and are cheaper, but tend to higher in caffeine content.  That said, that is pretty much what you get with this blend.  It's in all technical aspects a lower quality product, Robusto is considered a low end bean that you will almost never find it in American consumer coffee.  Even instant coffee tends to tout 100% Arabica as well-informed consumers prefer the full flavor.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Lavazza has decided to mix it, and so there's that coffee flavor coming from the Arabica, but it's mild due to how it's diluted.  The ""creaminess"" I would say comes in part from the very fine grind they use, hence it comes packaged in these vacuum-packed bricks that are more like a mold when you open the bag than the usual medium grind you'll see.  As a result, whether you drip or french press it, you get some of that bean filtrate coming through and it gives it a more creamy texture which is in all actuality the bean particulate coming through.<br /><br />Finally the caffeine kick is awesome, as it's probably 2x stronger than your average coffee thanks to the Robusto beans and the super fine grind, making it a solid wake up coffee.  I personally don't like the taste of it straight as compared to other 100% Arabica coffees like Sumatra or Columbian (which are my preferences) as it's just it's just too bland for my tastes but a touch of milk and sugar brings out more mellow flavors and again that subtle texture.  Good for mornings, but I wouldn't necessarily ever have it as my go to coffee my evening cup."	6	0

1	B0002QX3Q0	A17IV1N1MW8NF0	2 out of 3 dogs recommend...	2 out of 3 dogs recommend Charlee Bears!  (Actually-- lets go 4 of 5, because our first two dogs that both lived to ripe old ages but passed a few years ago also loved Charlee Bears.)<br /><br />They are great training treats because they are small, solid (so they don't turn to crumbs in a pocket), and not stinky.  (At least to the human nose.  I keep a ziplock of them in my coat pocket at all times and no one knows it but me and my dogs!)<br /><br />We also have a kong they fit nicely into without breaking.<br /><br />Good price at Amazon, too!<br /><br />And I should also mention that the third of our current canine buddies is weird.  We might not want to take her opinion into consideration... She's afraid of balloons, for example.  Ever seen a coonhound afraid of BALLOONS??  No clue why she won't eat these... but she won't eat a lot of stuff the other 2 dogs think are heavenly, but she will stick her head into a litter box.  Eeech.  She will actually take these treats that all dogs seem to love, and then spit them out... and then one of the other two dogs will grab it and gobble it up...  Such a pity... How are you supposed to train a dog that doesn't care if she gets the cookie?  Perhaps I should carry litter in my pocket, too.	0	0

Sounds dumb, but it really hadn't occurred to me.  I am a big fan of Gerber formula but these puffs win over Gerber without a doubt.  With Subscribe and Save these are a fantastic value.  They are organic and don;t have the sugar like the other brand.  We have also tried the banana and she loved those just as much.	0	0
1	B001AG6BMO	AWBGHDHH7E51F	Great for Skin and Hair	"I use this as a hair and scalp oil.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny. There's no greasy or residue buildup. It absorbs right into the hair and scalp,  If you apply to your hair, wait few minutes and then run your fingers through your hair, there will be no residue on your fingers--none.  Your hair will feel soft, supple, and look shiny.  A previous reviewer said she uses it on her skin. I do too. I usually put in on my face before bed.  Just like she said, it absorbs right into your skin and there is no residue.<br /><br />I started using it because my mom has uses it.  But, I never knew much about it.  I did an online search to find out more about this oil.  According to the information I got, with regular use, Coconut oil can help reverse sun damage and reduce signs of aging on your face and neck.  The article also said it helps eliminate ""liver spots""  The reason given was that coconut oil breaks down so fast that it really does absorb into the layers of your skin, instead of just sitting on the surface like so many face creams and lotions do.  It is good for the skin. I'm 50, and my skin is holding up pretty well.  I have very few ""liver"" spots near my ears, but absolutely none on my forehead and cheeks.  A lot of people have a whole face full of them by the time they are my age.  It is a healthy oil to consume.  It is solid, but it breaks down so easily in the body that the liver(the real organ) doesn't have to even get involved in the breaking down process, like it does with most fats we consume.  It's a shame, I always thought this was one of the worst oils you could eat.  Turns out, it's one of the best oils to consume.  If you do an online search, you can find a lot of information about the many benefits of coconut oil by an MD. You can even find out how it got it's bad reputation,"	78	2
1	B000H0ZJIG	A2UHC59S38QKXY	Zukes Mini Naturals - Healthy Treats	"Our toy poodle loves these treats!  We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for ""pee"" rewards and larger ones of another brand for ""poo"" rewards.  At first I thought this would be excessive, but when we tried to stop and she had a set back of accidents in the house we felt the rewards were a far better price to pay than messes in the house and punishing our dog.  So this way everyone is happy.  Since we give rewards several times daily we felt having all natural treats was a far better choice.  We have trained our dog to lay down while we are eating so no more begging; to roll over; sit; and stay using these treats.  Highly recommend!"	0	0
1	B0028H1H0U	A2DBFNIUL6U29L	A very good value	I originally bought Timothy's camomile tea and really liked it, but the price has doubled since then. I found this to be a great bargain and is just as good. I stocked up on it as the k cup prices seem to be getting out of control now.	1	0
1	B001HTKOWC	A3G4W5HHAV50HB	Moroccan Mint Tea	My wife & I enjoy this tea and really like the flavor.  We think it is better than other Moroccan Mint teas that we have tried.  Because it does have some caffeine, we drink it only in the morning or early afternoon.	0	0
1	B0002X8HB4	A2P5KEOGWW9NKA	Orange treat is better	Before I comment on the cookies. I want to inform buyers about the toy that you insert these into. Petsmart and other pet stores sell a blue ball. You stick a treat on both sides of that one. I purchased one and promptly had to return it...because on the car ride home my dog was able to get chunks of the blue plastic ripped off. I at that time decided to never purchase one of these again. However, I was recently at Pet Supplies Plus getting my sheltie groomed and I wanted to get a treat for my heavy chewer since she got left at home and was very unhappy. While browsing the treat insert toys(kong, etc) I noticed the orange ball of this that holds one cookie and small kibble or treats on the other side. I promptly dismissed it because of it being an everlasting toy. I continued to browse and when I realized that we either have or have tried pretty much every other treat stuffed toy. I decided to try it since if she ripped it apart they would refund my money and I would know if it was good or not.<br /><br />I got home and man oh man did I have a happy dog. She still has not even punctured the rough rubber. Unlike other reviewers stating that the treat came out easily in the blue ball this one did not. Once she had cleaned the middle out I could not get the treat out to save my life. I had to use a meat mallet to bust it apart. She does, however, get any kibble or other treats out of the backside very easily. We only put treats in the back when we need to get her interested again.<br /><br />Just to elaborate on the chewing power of my dog. She can eat a full rawhide in just an hour or so. (a large rawhide with the tied ends, she is 26 pounds). She has also demolished a couple of kong's and ate through the rope on the tug-a-jug toy. She also completely chewed trough the Twist-and-treat by the same company.<br /><br />The only other flaw I see with this product is the rubber. It is a lint/hair magnet. I hate picking it up and am constantly washing it because it picks up all the dog hair and lint possible...On the reverse side I love that it is not a toy that peanut butter or other semi solids work best in. I hate putting them in the kong because it leaves a very bad smell and clean up if not taken away promptly and cleaned.<br /><br />Onto the cookies. They are very hard and last her a couple hours of constant chewing. I have a large treat ball even though she is weighted into the medium. I find the oversized toys help prevent her getting a good grip and ripping it apart. She seems to love the flavor and loves when we put a new treat in. I do find them at a very good price compared to other refill treats.<br /><br />Over all I find it one of the best treat filled toy buys that we have made. It has out lasted any of the Kong's...even the black ones. It is easier to clean and provides her with a lot of enjoyment...and us with a lot of laughter as she tries to go at it.	0	0
1	B000HQNBSU	A3OXRFCJI67IMN	Delicious and Healthier Because It's  85% Cocoa	I have to have chocolate in my life. I'm finally able to be moderate about it. Not as moderate as Audrey Hepburn. I read that she was able to stop after having just one square of chocolate. I guess that depends on just how big that square was!<br /><br />I have obsessively researched dark chocolate and keep coming back to this one It takes great and, as long as I don't eat the whole thing in one sitting, is not excessive. THREE squares probably do it for me.<br /><br />I recommend Lindt Excellence Extra Dark Chocolate 85% for those who are trying to get their chocolate without abusing their health.	0	0
-1	B000TM6MWY	A1SNC605DLHRXE	Dangerous, do not give to kids!	I started buying these candies recently because my dentist told me to stop chewing gum. I usually have one driving home from work. The other day I was waiting for my husband to go out to dinner and I was starving so I had three. Big mistake. The third one burnt my tongue. Literally took the skin off. My tongue bled while I slept that night, I woke up with a throat coated with blood. Then it scabbed over and now the scabs are slowly peeling away, so I have dead skin kind of hanging off the middle of my tongue that I am afraid to remove because I don't want to start bleeding again.<br /><br />I've never in my life had this happen with any other candy. I recommend staying away from these!!!!	1	5

As a result, the contents were comprimised, creating a rancid smell and bitter taste.  After one teaspoon I was forced to discard the entire contents of my 3-pound bag, which resulted in a complete waste of money.  Amazon does not allow returns for this product.  Buyer BEWARE.	0	1
1	B00401OZ1U	A2JSDEIIS59HH4	Cool and refreshing - even when warm!	I have loved Metromint water for years and Peppermint is my favorite.  It has such a cool minty taste that I can drink it warm and still find it refreshing!<br /><br />I often chill it and drink it but it really comes in handy for sitatuions like:<br /><br />- keeping it at your desk at work<br />- keeping it next to your bed for a drink<br />- taking it on trips<br /><br />Because it tastes cool when warm, you can get by without chilling it.  Of course, you have to like the taste of mint.<br /><br />I have tried other flavors and they are all tasty too. I am not a big fan of the spearmint and the chocolate but that is a personal taste issue.<br /><br />I was going to order more and saw it was out of stock!  I am so disappointed as it is hard to find in the stores.	2	0
1	B006HYLW32	A2TX79GR278JMA	Life-saver for chip lovers trying to eat healthier	I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.	1	0
1	B000GFYRHG	AIQLQL7ACBLNP	wonderful	"My mom used to buy this tea as loose tea in a tin when I was a kid (many years ago).  I prefer the bags. As a kid, this was always the ""special occasion"" tea for holidays and such.  Not any more!  I drink it all the time.  The orange and spice, although not adding calories, adds greatly to the aroma and flavor.  This is my all-time favorite tea, so I don't mind getting 6 boxes at a time, even though I live alone!  Love, love, love it."	0	0

1	B00305L330	A12LSOIH7UAD7P	YUmmy!	I love this drink. I feel weird not drinking this in the morning as my usual hot drink replacing decaf/regular coffee. I noticed that the powder takes awhile to dissolve if you use milk. So, today I just used maybe 1/4 cup (just high enough to cover the 2 scoops of click powder) then shake I go...the powder dissolved right away and then I added milk and ice! I feel full when I drink this in the morning ;) I plan to continue drinking this for the next couple of months or longer...	0	0
1	B003GSK4CW	A1KN9VNUW677BC	Works as expected	Not much surprise here. They fit on the bottle perfectly, the look as pictured, and they work just as you'd expect. My only complaint are that the syrup tends to crystallize on the tip causing less to pump out than when I first started the bottle, and that the syrup comes out so forcefully that you have to be careful to avoid over-spray messes.	2	0
1	B001ELL3LY	A1DG04Y5F6FI4	Great product!	Since I do not drink a lot of milk, this is the best way to keep it on hand for cooking.  This particular product has excellent taste.

1	B00012182G	AT9Z4FWR847HL	Time saver	Like most country folks, I spend a lot of time trying to get the wild livestock on my property, arrows and atatali tend to be hard to use to hit small critters like rabbits and squirrels, shotguns and .22 tend to be noisy and scare the others making it difficult to get enough to feed the host of people that are waiting back at the house for dinner. This is a real time saver for only a few hundred dollars, I can feed all.  It would be better if it came with the fur and head so I could tan those and make a nice coat, hat or bed cover, after tanning the skin.  The best part of it is now my flower bed is over run with squirrels and rabbits.	4	4
-1	B001M0A66A	A1M0ILRB4KE3O5	Bit O' Honey 190-count	I was very disappointed with the freshness of this product.  I should have listened to the other reviewer.  I had ordered the 36 pack of bars last year and they were so fresh!  I thought the individual pieces would be more convenient.  It must be a different vendor.

This is a product I can never be without!<br /><br />I recommended this to a friend and a few months when I saw her she said that she recommended this to all her friends and they all started to lose weight :) and my friend lost 30lbs only drinking this, eating clean and working out a few days a week!

1	B003TNANSO	A2FE2YG8W9G8UW	Hard to believe it's good for you	I was looking for a replacement for my morning biscotti, something a bit more nutritious.  After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).  I'll be ordering these regularly through subscribe and save. I just have to make sure I don't eat them for snacks, just for breakfast, or I'll run out =)	0	0
-1	B003WLC4VC	A2NIWOK7H2EWRR	Low. Low. I repeat: Low.	"I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2"" wide, 4"" long, and 1/4"" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away."	14	2
1	B0007KLGC4	A1KVRCQE69E2CL	Deliciously unique!	I first tried a Mallo Cup when I was in Chicago recently for a convention.

-1	B000CQC050	AHY9FT07RILZM	Too much of a licorice smell and taste	Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.	1	0
1	B001FA1KLW	A24KSUEFPE36NP	Great for camping!	I use this on camping trips all the time , with one of the spaghetti sauce spice pouches from the grocery. Makes a great light weight meal with dried pasta. Just be sure to add some water, its pretty concentrated.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2	0
-1	B001D0DMME	A2E4ROH3UVXCEJ	Good but maybe my package was old.	I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.	1	0

I bought on accident (long story) nine containers of this coffee when I got the package I was over whelmed. Opening the container the coffee is very finely ground and very light in color but brews a wonderfully delicious cup of coffee and suprisingly dark.  I did add a little more then normal for a stronger brew. Your brewing results will vary as with any coffee factors such as  how it is brewed, the tempature, the water etc can make great coffee not so great.  Most of my cups of this were great and is now one of my favorites.	0	0
-1	B000QSLYK6	A3804TLWZL33O5	Not Recommended	The first ingredient in this product is corn. Dogs can't digest that ingredient and you should not feed them anything which contains it.<br /><br />This product also contains chicken, which unless boiled, can negatively impact canines in a variety of physical and behavioral ways.<br /><br />Finally, this product contains a number of fillers and processed carbohydrates. Dry kibbles in general aren't very nutritive and I don't think this is the worst of the bunch out there. But it certainly isn't one of the best.	1	8
-1	B008FHUGNQ	A2H2PYIIJZ4F19	Coffee People & Amazon needs better QC	I've been ordering subscribe and save for a while, but I think I'm done with this. When I opened the box, loose coffee scattered all over the floor, and all of 47 cups were stained/soiled with coffee. ( yes, I counted twice and only 47 were in the box of 50)  16 cups were opened, including 3 cups which were totally empty inside.  With the trouble of sweeping the floor and cleaning each individual remaining cups, buying this product from Amazon does't save me anything. I've been such a big fun of this coffee, but I will not give another shot.	0	2
1	B000DZKKK2	A3UA1LWHAWFIOY	Wonderful for children who are gluten free and casein free	My son has autism and is on the GFCF diet.  He loves this mix made into cookies.  I remove the chocolate chunks ( trying to keep them as low in sugar as possible)  and I add 8 tspns benefiber and 1/4 cup baby rice cereal to boost the nutrition.  Then I add 1/4 cup flax oil and 1/4 cup olive oil and bake on a pizza stone - they never burn on the pizza stone - might burn if cooked on conventional bakeware.  My son love these and he is a very very picky eater.  The brownies that this mix makes are fabulous, too.  Great for birthday parties.	0	0
1	B002LANN56	A12E0Y0J6584RT	If I could give it 10 stars I would!	Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food puts other dog foods to shame. This 4.5 pound bag is filled with Real Beef which is Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor, Potato, and Green Been Garnishes. Sounds like a proper steak house meal right? It looks like it too, what you see on the outside of the bad is exactly what you get on the inside, big chunky pieces of beef that your dog will go crazy over. Even my cat stopped eating her food and tried to sneak a nibble of this she was so enticed. With 23 extra vitamins this is an excellent choice for a healthy adult dog. I would highly recommend this to any dog lover.	0	0

Of the higher quality dog foods on the market, Ziwi Peak is the only one without carrots or barley (two foods she cannot have).  Lucy loves this food and her allergies are much better--there are no grains, fillers, colors, preservatives or vegetables (I can give her those separately from home).  Without Ziwi peak I would be making stuff at home.  This is convenient and well worth the price--I only wish I could find a local retailer so I wouldn't have to order online...	1	0

1	B002R8UANK	A3RFNCMOL3FSE8	Healthy, low cal treats	These treats have nothing bad in them! For those of you looking for corn-free, wheat-free, hydrogenated oil-free treats, these fit the bill.<br />They are about the size of a nickel, and they break in half easily. And at just under nine calories each (4 cal broken), they are perfect for my Jack Russel who basically gets a treat for every event in his day. After he potties, whenever he comes in from playing, whenever I come in from outside, pretty much any time the door opens & closes he gets a treat. He loves these (& the blueberry ones as well) and I don't feel bad about giving them to him throughout the day.	0	0
1	B007RJELUM	A1XUKVLJAHUFDA	Delicious! (If you are a cat)	Picked up a couple of cases of this on sale for my favorite feline to try, she can be notoriously finicky and will often devour the first can of some new brand of food but turn her nose up to the same after three or four cans.  Going strong at nine cans now and she is still pouncing on it like it was can 1.  Has a pleasant enough texture with a nice little bit of juiciness (gravy) to make it all go down smooth, an ingredients list that has actual ingredients in it and most important it makes her happy so that makes me happy.	1	0

-1	B005VOOM2W	ANTN61S4L7WG9	OK coffee, but there are better alternatives	"I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K"">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI"">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find ""burnt"", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G"">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars."	0	0

We had this from the market (pricy) and my whole family loved it, but it was too expensive to keep purchasing, so I went to Amazon and got whole box of supply ..which brought down to the reasonable price for per package.<br /><br />We love it because:<br />it's not too sweet,<br />healty alternative than other stuff<br />my whole family love them<br /><br />I serve this at the party and so many people asked me where I got it!<br />So, now I leave the package right by the dish, so that I don't have to fetch the bag everytime people ask...that's how much people seems to like this apple chip!<br /><br />Try it and you'll find out for yourself!	2	1

1	B004SRH2B6	AQ7EZCXB3NY39	Mango is really mango-e	"If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an ""organic"" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the ""essence of mango"" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.<br /><br />I would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it. This water does not taste like the water you would get from the Asian countries. I cant really explain why either."	5	2

1	B000F4J746	A3W3BW8TQWTNQH	Nice mild tea for non-tea drinkers	"About three years ago I was diagnosed with two bleeding ulcers (which fortunately healed quite quickly once I stopped taking all NSAIDs and took the heavy-duty prescription antacid drugs morning and night).  The gastroenterologist did NOT tell me to quit drinking coffee, but although I had been a coffee drinker since high school, all the coffees suddenly seemed much too acid; I HAD been drinking regular coffee until about 3 p.m., then decaf after dinner - but even the decaf just seemed ""too much.""  However, in the morning especially, I did crave a bit of a caffeine jolt, and I was definitely accustomed to a HOT drink at breakfast.  My parents and my husband were always at least occasional tea drinkers, so we had the major brands of American grocery store tea around the house - I found them all unpalatable, and usually did not even finish the mug after I fixed some.  Then I started trying the ""fancier"" teas, starting with ""assortment"" packs.  My husband had warned me that there was SOMETHING in the Earl Grey teas that made them taste really odd - well, that something turned out to be bergamot, and I did not care for it either.  So, at least I had eliminated all types of Earl Grey tea...  Fortunately it did not take me too long to stumble across the Twinings Prince of Wales tea, and it was like Goldilocks and the porridge - just right.  With coffee I always drank it black, but with tea I do use about a teaspoon and half of honey.  As far as I can tell, the Prince of Wales does not come in a decaf version, so in the evening I drink chamomile tea (and that varies a lot from brand to brand!).  Unfortunately the Prince of Wales tea is only available at one grocery store near me, and sometimes they are all sold out.  So, I finally realized that I should sign up for the Amazon ""subscribe & save"" for this tea.  The tea bags come wrapped in foil packets (as I think all Twinings tea bags do), so it's easy to take them along when traveling, or just to carry one in a purse or wallet."	0	0

1	B00014DAHU	A1YUL9PCJR3JTY	Delightful, Tasty, Healthy Tea for Digestive Support...Superb!	"*****<br /><br />This Lemon Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is for easing occasional indigestion and gas, and for enhancing circulation. It's a delightful, all natural tea made from ginger root, lemon grass, lemon peel, licorice root, black pepper, peppermint leaf, natural lemon flavor, ascorbic acid, and natural licorice flavor. Most of the ingredients are organic. The taste is lemony, peppery, slightly herby and a little sweet, very nice anytime, but especially after a meal. It's a very unique tea that is a true treat.<br /><br />This is my second Yogi Tea to taste and review, and I am definitely impressed with the tea and the company. Lemon Ginger Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Lemon Ginger tea is a special healing formula designed to aid digestion, ease upset stomach and provide a caffeine-free pick-me-up. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used for centuries to treat minor stomach ailments, warm the metabolism and reduce nausea associated with motion. Ayurvedic practitioners have historically regarded Ginger as the ""universal medicine"" because of the way it catalyzes the benefits of other medicinal herbs. The World Health Organization (1999) reports that Ginger stimulates the appetite and can be useful in a wide variety of stomach complaints. Made with Organic Ginger, this blend is formulated to boost digestion and circulation. The sourness of Lemon promotes the secretion of digestive juices and provides the perfect counterpart to the pungent-sweet taste of Ginger. Our formula is augmented with Organic Licorice, to support the adrenals and enhance the effectiveness of other healing herbs; Organic Peppermint, to help with digestion and reduce gas; and Organic Black Pepper, a powerful detoxifier. For centuries, Lemon and Ginger have been used together for their complementary tastes and healing properties. Enjoy a cup of Lemon Ginger tea when your tummy needs a little taming, when you need to reinvigorate your body and mind, or when you just want a delicious healthy drink.""<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that Yogi Tea also makes a Green Tea Lemon Ginger that is mostly a green tea and that includes caffeine; the packaging looks a little similar, so make sure you're getting the tea that you want.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"	0	0

I have two of them and I absolutely love them.  I make the baby food then freeze it.  If I have too much food and not enough tray space, I freeze some and then pop them out and put them in another tubberware container.  Whenever it is time for him to eat.  I pop one out, put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and we are good to go.  I even freeze my homemade rice cereal which makes it so much easier.  I would recommend this product because it is easy and cleans really well.	1	0

1	B005A7X56Y	A25LP5X4SEZ7NT	This Stuff Works!	"I am a life-long shift worker. For the past several years, I've been working the overnight shift in a stressful job. Sleeping during the day (usually early afternoon to mid-evening) is always difficult but more so when I'm stressed. I've been given prescriptions for sleep medications, which I have used and which work sometimes but other times have left me feeling not fully rested, like the sleep was artificial. I saw this here on Amazon, read the info (no sugar which is good because sugar for me is absolute poison) no calories, no carbs. I said ""what the heck"" and ordered some Serenity.<br /><br />To my utter astonishment, this beverage worked! I tried it out first time a few days after I received it. I took it about an hour before my usual bedtime. Within a half-hour, I started feeling VERY relaxed and before I knew it, I was asleep. Not only that, I slept straight through to the alarm clock sounding me awake! I thought, ""FLUKE!""<br /><br />The next day, I did it again and had pretty much the same result. This time, I awoke once for a quick trip to the, uh, ""john"", but when I returned to bed, I fell right into sleep again (which is the other problem with prescription sleep meds that once I awaken for whatever reason, that's IT! No going back to sleep at all!).<br /><br />So, I've been using this product for the past two weeks with no discernible side effects, not even residual drowsiness once I get to work AND I've been sleeping 5-6 hours and feeling rested when I awaken. Which, to me, after years of sleep issues, is nothing short of astounding!<br /><br />I will perhaps update this review in the future, depending on whether or not this product loses its effectiveness with regular use (prescription meds do lose their effectiveness once the body acclimates to them, which has always meant that I stop taking them for a while which means not getting regular, uninterrupted, peaceful sleep which means being tired and worn-out which means life is not so much fun when I'm tired all the time).<br /><br />But, for now, I give Serenity Relaxation Beverage a thumbs-up, glowing review"	0	0

-1	B00451WLYI	A1EAI6VPPNWDHP	Not bad when I split the package into 2 portions	I decided to give Starbucks a try as I've been looking for a good instant decaf coffee. I poured the first pouch in its entirety into my cup and thought I was drinking tar. For the next one I only used half a pouch and got a much more mellow and enjoyable cup. Clearly, my palette is not well suited to overly strong coffee. I suppose I would buy this again, but not before shopping around and trying a different decaf.	1	0
1	B003M5XJ6C	A38EFNLM513DVD	It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.	"Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like ""chicken"" or ""chicken meal"" and  you do not want things like ""meat byproduct.""  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the ""Holistic""label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become."	3	0

1	B005Y10XZ2	AERBY54RWPSO9	surprisingly not bad	I pretty much shop exclusively in the natural/organic food department in my grocery store and those few times that I have strayed and read labels I was always reminded why I don't shop in the normal part of the grocery store.  These bars are not bad at all.  So many others I have looked at have hidden artificial sweeteners (like aspartame) in them, but not these, only 8 grams of sugar per bar (our household limit is 9 grams per serving of any food) and there is a tiny bit of stevia, but I have no problem with that since I am a big stevia believer.  These have only 130 calories so it can be a snack (if a protein bar gets to be too high in calories it really ought to be a meal replacement) and these are chocolatey enough to satisfy my chocolate craving.  These have 3 grams of fiber, not so much, but then these are not trying to be fiber bars.  These bars have 9 grams of protein, not bad, but it appears to be all soy based, but since it is not SO much protein I guess that is fine (too much soy is not good).  There is some palm oil which I am not a fan of (not ecologically sound and it is cholesterol raising), but few processed foods out there are perfect.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs a little something sweet and chocolatey that is low enough in calories to be a snack and who isn't so hung up on natural/organic foods.  From what I've seen in the conventional food isles these are quite clean and they taste good.  While I say that I recommend them, for me personally I will still go back to buying my old standby in the natural foods department, NuGo Slim.	0	0

The only problem is that the actual sprinkles are not even close to being the colors shown on the package. They show: green, pink, yellow and white. I have a hard time seeing that they have are anything but white unless I am really close, and when I used them on white icing they weren't really noticeable. Bummer.

1	B002RBOCZE	AVCA4Z9OEHDP1	Surprisingly smooth	"The natural bitterness of the intense cocoa is very well balanced by the carefully chosen quantity of other few and simple ingredients -- especially the vanilla.  It melts slowly in your mouth into a very fine, rich, and especially smooth presentation, allowing one to really appreciate the taste of cocoa.  I'm not a food snob, but I've tasted a LOT of dark chocolate, and the other ingredients in this Lindt dark chocolate really ""dress up"" and present the cocoa well.  Not overdone with too much sugar, nor underdone leaving it neither too bitter in taste, nor too chalky/chunky in texture to enjoy.<br /><br />I have to agree with other reviewers, too:  the 90% really is smoother than 85%.  Essentially that's the challenge, right?  Get as close as you can to enjoying the bean for what it is.  They work harder to do this (and succeed in my opinion) with 90% versus 85%."	4	0
1	B000H23Z1C	A1589GXXDYFNR9	Best combo of chili spices I've found	"I've used Carroll Shelby's Chili Kit for quite a few years now, and it's my favorite mix. It's a nice blend of spices, and takes the guess work out of figuring out how much chili powder to use.  I recommend using about half of the ""hot"" (cayenne pepper) spice pack unless you really like your chili super hot.  Also works great if you add diced tomatoes and Rotel or mild peppers and onion.  I've been purchasing from local markets for a long time, and then suddenly could not find it in stores.  Amazon to the rescue."	0	0
1	B003M5PTU6	A3JWUFBEH12B4U	Spaghetti perfetto! Really really perfect!	"It took me a while, but recently I had the chance to try this pasta for the first time. I have known Latini, Martelli, Morelli and Rustichella d'Abruzzo for many years, but this pastificio was unknown to me.<br /><br />I am enthused about the consistence of this tasty pasta. It was just right, actually it was just perfect. It was al dente, as Italians would say. But not hard inside, and not too soft either. It had this tiny resistance that you want and not often get from even good pastificie (and of course never from ordinary supermarket-bought brands!)...<br /><br />I made a version of Ratatouille in the oven, with all fresh produce, and then added the freshly cooked spaghetti to it, mingled it well. It was so delicious!<br /><br />I will order this again, and definitely also try its ""brothers"" (the other varieries from Faella)."	0	0
1	B001E0ZNNO	A1GEDJVR2QRGEB	Quick and inexpensive	I live in a very rural area. There is a store about 15 miles away that sells Alvita teas. The last two times I have been there they have been out of Valerian Root Tea. i find this product very effective in helping me sleep. This seller was inexpensive and responded very quickly to my order. Thank you!	0	0
1	B004U43ZO0	A1QG13XG3EO2CX	gooey chewy and chocolatey	These are chewy chips ahoy cookies (not the crunchy ones), with a chocolate fudge baked into them. What could there possibly be not to like? ;-) The fudge is uniformly and well distributed throughout the cookie and it complements the cookie part well. The overall taste is very rich and very delicious. The soft chewy cookie complements the texture of the soft fudge very well. My only gripe is that the chocolate chips and the chocolate fudge create too many somewhat clashing textures. I think the cookie would be better if it had just the fudge inside the cookie without the chocolate chips.	0	1
1	B008JKTTUA	AQLL2R1PPR46X	Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants	Delicious bar! I love it.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I love the crunchy pomegranates in it.  I reach for these bars ever morning for breakfast or a quick snack.  One thing I love about KIND bars is even if they have crisp rice, it's not the majority of the bar like some other bars out there.  The bar is mostly nuts and fruits as advertised.  Overall, just a great and healthy snack to keep on hand.	0	0

-1	B006N3I69A	A29AY9EKFE4GCS	I threw it all away.	"You get what you pay for.  I couldn't resist the price of this coffee.  It was much less expensive, but how bad can coffee be?  Try this and you will know just how bad it can get.  Just after it started to brew I noticed the ""brew"" coming from the Keurig was nearly clear water.  Not a good sign.  It tasted terrible, just like the old instant coffee I drank 30 years ago.  I cut open the cup, there was nothing left inside.  It was instant coffee.  Then I cut open an unused cup and, sure enough, it looked just like the instant coffee I drank 30 years ago - coffee crystals not coffee grounds.  I read the packaging more carefully, and, in fact, it does say it is instant coffee.  Well, aren't all k-cups instant?  Don't waste your money.  Horrible stuff."	0	1
-1	B004LOABSC	AEKV8B2GGD32V	Disappointed	"I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews about them not being ""thick"".  But, since I couldn't find any other thick bully sticks on here, I thought I'd give them a shot.  Well, I am very disappointed!  They are not thick at all.  They are the same, ""slim jim"" thickness as every other bully stick I've bought before.  I'm not even sure why they advertise them as thick.  The thickest one is MAYBE as big around as a dime.  Not at all what I expected, and I won't order them again. I kept them just because they are at least cheaper than the same size ones I can get at the store - and it's a pain to have to return them.  My 10 month old beagle consumed one in less than an hour, start to finish.  I was hoping to find something that would last longer than that!"	0	1

-1	B004YV80O4	A1BTNPMESS99PL	Not bad, not great	I'm a fan of Velveeta cheese and even enjoy their shells and cheese, so I had high hopes for this. Although my 6 year old daughter liked it, I am not a fan. It's okay at best. The flavor does not accurately represent the deliciousness of the original Velveeta cheese. I would suggest you at least give it a try. I will purchase it since my daughter enjoys it, but it will not be a staple in our household.	2	1

1	B001D3K2HE	A2I9F2HQ7QJ3VB	Great for convenience bulk purchase	I found this as a good way of purchasing gum in bulk (I tend to chew a lot) rather then purchasing them in 3 packs from the grocery store.  The gum is fairly long lasting, better then other similar gums.  The price is still a little high compared to alternatives, I found that bj's had a 15 pack at a price significantly cheaper per stick so it might be worthwhile to price it out with any local bulk stores.  If those types of warehouse stores aren't an option, then this is a great alternative.	0	0
1	B005HXGHO8	ACQY0PA2XHJYI	great healthy choice	I bought this at a local store and thought I would try something new.  I don't have a lot of experience cooking with beans other than chili.  I looked up lentil soup recipes and tried this cooked in chicken broth and made like a soup.  I sauteed onions and garlic in olive oil. Added chicken broth, beans, carrots, curry powder, ketchup, and cooked for about 35 minutes.  Then processed in the blender to make smooth.  Added lemon juice and olive oil and this made a great soup.  If you don't like the texture of beans, the blender fixes that nicely.  You can also do these with chili powder and make it have a mexican/refried bean flavor.  great product.  very versitile.	0	0

I really like the the flavors of both but actually the Tandoori texture better (tougher actually, ginger is MUCH softer- hence tandoori is a longer eating snack : ), but the tandoori does give me heartburn and the ginger did not.<br /><br />Really wish Ginger and other flavors had less sugar : (.

For a really great bulk olive mix, try the Vigo mixed olives also on Amazon.	4	1

Amy's Lentil Soup not only fits her diet restrictions, but is so good that we'd both eat it even if there were no restrictions.

Do yourself and your cat a favor, and feed him high quality food.  Avoid the typical grocery store brands.  Wellness is of course more expensive, but well worth it.  Your cat will live a long, healthy life.	3	0
1	B003D4GSGA	A1YUL9PCJR3JTY	Hibiscus and Raspberry--Lovely!	****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, and that's great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****	2	1

-1	B000M7YEAS	A1FBGJNQVIM20Z	Not good	"I recently purchased WalMart's Great Value brand hot dog Chili Sauce.  I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it.  I make my own chili but I did not have any frozen and I was really jonesing for a chili dog or two.  I was surprised.  The Great Value stuff was adequate.  Not terribly spicy, but good.<br /><br />I saw this stuff in my local grocery store yesterday and thought, ""Texas Pete's?  It has to blow away the Gv stuff!""  I bought it.<br /><br />Well, the taste is terrible.  There is almost no level of spice flavor detectable.  I've compared the ingredient labels and the GV stuff contains ""prepared dried beans"" and ""beef fat"", whereas Texas Pete's contain ""soy grits"" and soybean oil.<br /><br />I was terribly disappointed."	1	0
-1	B001P22GHC	A2L4JFETZWBQPS	Good price, hard to squeeze and not as tasty as others	While I like that these are inexpensive and come in nice little single serving size pouches there are a couple problems with this product:<br /><br />1) The pouches are very difficult to squeeze, the almond butter seems hardened as other reviewers have also mentioned<br /><br />2) The pouches do not really contain a full serving unless 1 tablespoon is a serving.  Usually 2 tablespoons is condiered a serving of nut butter.  1 tbsp is really not enough to spread for a sandwich.<br /><br />3) The consistency of this almond butter is kind of sticky/ gooey compared with other more creamy ones I have tried (ie Trader Joe's).	2	1

1	B004SEU950	A3JTRV5DXHAQVT	Delicious	The sugar crisp cookies are delicious. I am gluten intolerant, but my husband is not and he loves them too. I like the chocolate chip almost as much.<br />They are better than anything I can make at home with a gluten free mix or gluten free flour. They remind me of what I used to make at Christmas before the gluten intolerance. I can't believe they can make these without allergens.<br />I also use them to make almost instant no bake cheesecakes.<br />You can use store bought cheesecake filling on top of a cookie or make your own.<br />I use 4 oz mascarpone, 1 t (or more) lemon juice, 1 T (or more) confectioners sugar 1 t vanilla.<br />I mix all of this and spread it on top of 2 cookies and top them with 1 crumbled cookie.	1	0
1	B001KTA03C	A23GFTVIETX7DS	One of my favorite flavors!	I love my coffee strong and black, but I don't like the harsh and sometimes burned flavors that many extra-bold K-cups have.  Double Black Diamond is the perfect blend for me; I actually hoard my supply in my house.  The flavor is more intense than many others while still maintaining balance.  Not for the faint-of-heart, this blend approached but stops short of espresso strength.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1	1
1	B0041CIR62	A23F3VXX0SNXN	Delicious, gluten free noodles	I couldn't wait to try these noodles. My physician recommended that I adopt a wheat free, gluten free diet to reduce inflammation. It seemed to me that everything I ate contained wheat, and I was concerned about finding delicious, wheat free, gluten free foods.  These brown rice noodles are just what I was looking for.  These noodles are as easy to cook as ramen noodles, but so much more tasty.  I used it in chicken broth with mushrooms, bean sprouts, and tofu.  Delicious.  You will like these.	0	1

My variety pack was a pretty good mix.  Thankfully it only had a couple decaf.  I had none of the breaking open problems that other people have talked about so I guess they must have fixed that.  I hope there will be packs listed in the future that let me get boxes of just the ones I really liked, which is kind of the point of trying a variety, I think.

-1	B000C0TNH4	A214DG8Y09M3W9	If you've  never had good honeycomb, this is okay...	...but if you've had the good stuff, this is a little bit disappointing. The wax is very waxy tasting, instead of being really infused with the honey and instead of being soft and pliable, it was brittle, which is something I've never experienced with honeycomb. Additionally, the comb part wasn't full and complete--the edges were broken and there were broken 'holes' in the interior part of it, instead of being a weavy-comb like it should have been.<br /><br />On the plus side, there was a good amount of honey in the box and the plastic packaging that it's in is hard plastic with an easy enough pop top to it. When the product was delivered, it had melted and slid all to one side, and had leaked out of the packaging. I'm not rating this product by the packaging or the shipping though (I gave shipping feedback elsewhere). This is just about the honeycomb product inside.<br /><br />It's not bad and if you've never had the good stuff, for a fair price, this one is fine enough maybe to get for the kids to try it. If you're wanting it for cooking, for a gourmet or specialty display or to use for something that requires a solid, full and soft, pliable wax, this isn't your product.<br /><br />But for just sucking on some honeycomb and chewing some wax, for kids who don't know the difference, or even for breaking off a piece to drop into a tea or a hot drink, this is good enough, at a fair enough price.	1	0

I make it with sugar and some French Vanilla creamer (liquid, not the powdery stuff) and let me tell you what...I am serious when I say it is the best cup of coffee I have ever had. It's too bad they only ""release"" it around the holidays. I would drink it year round. In fact, this is why I am visiting Amazon right now....trying to see if I can order it in bulk and freeze it.<br />I drink coffee every morning, at least 1 24oz mug, sometimes 2. If I could choose only one type of coffee to drink for the rest of my life, this one would be it.<br />As far as the pricing goes...it is a little on the expensive side here. Major retailers carry the same bag for less than 10 bucks each. (8.99 last I checked).<br />If you are in the mood for some good coffee, with the holidays right around the corner, pick yourself up some of the Holiday Peppermint. If you don't like it, send it to me!!"	0	0

1	B001C90SGY	A22CW0ZHY3NJH8	Good spread	My son survives on this stuff. It's very chocolaty. I agree it is very sweet. I like the hint of hazelnut and I like it as a spread on crackers or toast. My son will eat it with peanut butter in a sandwich. It's good, especially for chocolate lovers.<br /><br />________________<br /><br />UPDATE:  This listing is for the 3-pack.  I actually think it's better to buy smaller jars in larger quantities, because the Nutella tends to dry out if used up too slowly.  The listing doesn't state how large the jars are and they do come in various sizes.  Three small jars is better than one large jar.	7	1
1	B00066N9OC	A2RT67P0QCU8PZ	I love this pickled stuff!	"Product arrived promptly and securely packaged. The turkey gizzards were very tender but somewhat mild in flavor (dipped them in mustard to add a little ""zest"" to them when I ate them). Pork Hocks were also tender with a mild flavor. The Polish Sausage I liked the best - a sweeter, vinegary taste (it was hard for me not to eat the whole jar of Polish Sausage in one sitting). The eggs were fine (used them - sliced - on salads).<br /><br />All-in-all, I was very pleased with the sampler as well as the service from WisconsinMade."	0	0

1	B0001CXUHW	A3M8R4JD1SIS76	A Well-Kept Secret	Have you ever wanted to know how professional bakers could afford to bake bread and rolls  and give them away with the price of yeast as high as it is?<br /><br />Here's the secret:  SAF-Instant Yeast!  A 16-ounce will last for all the home baking most people will do for months, or perhaps years.  It is supposed to last one year, but it can  easily last 5-10 years, according to a number of sources.  It is to be stored in a cool dry place.<br /><br />SAF Instant Yeast is a powerful and fast-acting yeast.  It can be added to dry ingredients directly.  It is  twice  as active as regular compressed yeast.	41	2

I eat them every morning on my cereal, combined with peanut butter, a great pairing. After I was hooked, my local grocery store stopped carrying them, so I went online and found them here. Now, I order a box every couple months. If you're looking for big, moist raisins, these would be hard to beat.	4	0
1	B001BCUBZ0	A1GH61J2MX73KX	Excellent cat food.	My large dude-cat Larry loves to eat. When he gained a bit of weight I put him on Natural Balance low cal food and his fur began to fall out. It was dry and patchy. Well, one 15 pound bag of this stuff later he has slimmed down nicely, and he has the best coat he has ever had. He looks and feels great. He also loves this food. It's a win-win all round, and well worth the price -- much cheaper than visits to the vet for any weight / skin related illnesses. We are very happy customers, and with Amazon prime, its delivered to your door with free shipping. (To the mailman's amusement.)	0	0
-1	B0099AUJBW	A19JXIGUAL6VG5	Lots of spice, not much pumpkin, but wow great customer service	I agree with other reviews regarding the very high spice levels in this syrup.  I normally like a lot of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, etc but this syrup had too much for me.  The syrup smells like it will have more pumpkin flavor, but that is not delivered in taste.<br /><br />Amended review 10/25/12 : This company is better at customer service than any other consumer food company I have dealt with.  Perhaps it is due to the strong customer orientation in the part of their business selling high end products to bakeries, food service operations and food companies.  I got a call the same day as I filed my original review.  On that call I learned that their syrups are more concentrated so I need to make sure I go easy on the pumps.  Because they are concentrated and less sweet,  they have only 35 calories per serving which is much less than other syrups and makes it easier to use on my greek yogurt.  I also learned they are working on a third version of a pumpkin syrup which says a lot about how responsive they are to consumer feedback.  To make sure I understood they make high quality products, they also sent me some samples of their other lines which were all very tasty.<br /><br />So if you see a product from Amoretti that you are interested in, give it a try.  It is probably very good.  If it turns out the flavor is not to your liking, the company will make it right as they did for me.	0	0

1	B001VE8C36	A2ES1KJNG9P4QV	Great tasting cotton candy	I bought this and repackaged it for a baby shower.  It had a very slight cinammon flavor and pink, it's not like the puffy cotton candy you would get freshly made and you can't refluff it, I tried, but it was definitely worth the price I paid for it and what I needed it for.

1	B004JRMG98	AKAZT5193KFR1	The Jalapeno Story	I love the taste of jalapenos but not if they're too hot. My grandfather used to eat jalapeno sandwiches with white bread. I once begged him for a bite and it was so hot I spit it out as I turned red as a beet. I never asked him for another bite but he sure had a good laugh. Anyway, this sauce is a little too hot for my tastes so I add a little ranch to it.<br />I did spread a fine layer on a quesadilla and it tasted great. It's a little runny so watch out!<br />P.S. If you're canning salsa this fall and use jalapenos, wear surgical gloves when you cut them up. I didn't and rubbed my eyes as I was cutting up the onions. It burned so bad!<br />If my grandfather could have seen my eyes burning red and the tears streaming down my face, he would have another good laugh. He's probably in heaven laughing at me anyway.	1	1

-1	B0030H1WW0	A5A6V9TKED7Q9	Buyer Beware - it's not coffee!	Why they call this Cafe Mocha is beyond me.<br />Yes, it tastes like watery hot chocolate with a hint of weak coffee.<br />But if you were to open the package, you won't find any coffee grounds,<br />instead you will find POWDERED COCOA MIX that evaporates when it fills with water.<br />Now I don't mind paying $10.00+ for a box of decent coffee,<br />but to find out that the pods don't even contain any coffee really ticked me off.<br />And with that, I hope to have saved you the trouble of ordering this junk.<br />Cheers!	51	1

1	B008RWUHA6	A2K89R0B20LYHB	LOVE this!	This is probably the best granola I have ever had. It only has 6 grams of sugar, where most granola cereals have 15 grams or more. The taste is incredible; a well rounded cinnamon flavor and the granola itself is pretty uniform in texture which I like. No huge clumps. The flax seeds are also a nice touch and lend good flavor to the mix. I also like the packaging. Its compact and easy to both open and seal back up. I was about to give up on store bought granola but this changed my mind. Love it.	0	0

1	B000NYFBCA	A1Z0K3LNNGE24M	Perfect for my purposes	First off let me say I know it's probably kind of weird for the average consumer to buy 64 ounces of soy sauce at a time. However, I and my husband make our own jerky and marinate steaks on a regular basis, so that is why we bought two bottles of this. Previously, we just bought it at the store but this was a more economical alternative and being soy sauce, it will store well. I'd have bought full gallons if it were available that way.<br /><br />I've never been able to tell a difference in taste between this lite version and the normal, so especially if you're watching sodium it is a good choice. We bought two of these and we'll probably use them pretty quickly.	0	0
-1	B000SATIZA	A2SG181286O8M8	Clump of dirt found in product	"I recently purchased this product and thought it strange that it showed evidence of grit/dirt (i.e. when I steeped the tea in a glass jar I noticed that after pouring out the tea grit remained on the threads of the jar).  When I opened the 2nd bag that I purchased, about 1 month later, I found a clump of dirt (approximately 1/2"" in diameter).  I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e-mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was ""If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange/refund"".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated ""we will exchange/refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)"".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.  Not sure if they will look into this situation more closely to prevent this problem in the future or not but check product for evidence of dirt if you are purchasing this product in the future.<br /><br />Update (2/27/12) - Davidson's did get back with me and sent me a new bag without charge when filling out the Amazon claim form.  Have not opened up the new bag to see if the quality has improved, but replacement bag was appreciated."	16	0
1	B006GCMIE2	A3RHJ2NSFH6LCT	Amazing!	Ever since I attended nursing school, I have been wary of salt. I'm trying to cut salt from my diet now while I am young so it isn't difficult to make the shift when I get older. This is an AMAZING product, I can't believe it is salt free. I put it on everything!

I have been using Que Bueno Sauce since '82', But they have either changed the recipe drasticaly in the last year or 2, or Chef-Mate has it made cheaper for their label, it's orange, not creamy yellow, Not even a little spicy. I've seen it under 3 label brands, Ortega - the original (the one I used), Nestle, and Chef-Mate. This is no better than Gordon Food Service sauce at $8.00 a can.

So I said to myself hey I can buy soda water in my store for 88 cents per 2 liters and the syrup makes 6 or so liters per bottle depending on how strong you want the taste I buy the energy mix 2 or 3 bottles at a time and it lasts me about a month I still buy other soda buy much less and no more paying 3 bucks a can for red bull,oh side note if you are into jager bombs and so are your party friends buy a bottle of this and some soda water bottle of jager and have fun in my opinion it tastes better than real red bull"	0	0

1	B000COEZXC	A21BPBG2JZ0PVO	Easy to give even large pills; how to increase its appeal	I've never bought a six-pack - I buy four at a time from an amazon.com store. But I've used this product regularly for well over a year, and it will usually administer even a large pill (Azodyl, which is very large for cats) without a fuss. My cat simply gobbles it up, pill and all.<br /><br />I admit that I have to doctor it a little. My cat isn't attracted enough by the Pill Pocket flavor alone, even his favorite Salmon. I powder a little of the soft variety of Whisker Lickin's (kitty junk food, but the vet says a little won't hurt) in the palm of my hand and roll the filled pocket in it. His Majesty will then eat it willingly, nineteen times of out twenty.<br /><br />In fact, I have to cut this short because he's pawing at me. He has food, so no doubt I need to get an Azodyl and fix him a doctored Pill Pocket.<br /><br />Good stuff!! Thanks for making it, Greenies!	1	0

1	B001BCUBZ0	A2SZLNSI5KOQJT	Cats LOVE this Dry Food.  Best Commercial Product List I've Found that in Reasonably Priced Commercial Pet Food. RECOMMENDED.	"I have 4 cats ranging in age from 2-10 years old.  We previously fed them Iams Multi-Cat dry food which we purchased in 20lb bags at our local warehouse store.  About 4 months ago, the warehouse store discontinued stocking Iams cat food, so I went looking for another, better quality dry cat food that was reasonably priced (my preference was to make my own cat food, but the reality is that I don't have time to do so).<br /><br />I stumbled on Castor & Pollux on Amazon & decided to give the blue bag (adult feline) a try.  We've now gone through 27lbs of the adult feline dry food and like the Castor & Pollux dry food enough to make this our cat food of choice (so I have to remember to order ahead of time to not run out).  We are now trying the green bag (indoor cat), so that review will come later after we go through a bag or 2 (15lb bags).<br /><br />Since it is not listed, and I wanted to know this information before I purchased, here is a full List of ingredients straight from the back of the blue bag:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Menhaden Fish Meal, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Brewers Rice, Chicken Fat preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Salmon Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Potatoes, Cultured Whey, Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Sodium Bisulfate, Potassium Choloride, Salt, Dried, Blueberries, Dried Papya, Choline Chloride, Taurine, DL-Methionine, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Niacin, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydroxcholoride (source of Vitamin B6), Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin K1 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyes Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophuilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longbrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles.<br /><br />My older cats (8 & 10 yrs) had a hard transition from the Iams.  We cleaned up a lot of carrot-filled cat vomit for the first 2 weeks.  The younger cats transitioned with no issues whatsoever.  We have since gone to the indoor feline and are not experiencing the daily upchucking (whether this is because they are already accustomed to the food or not, I don't know, but would assume that it plays a part).  All cats love the food.  We did find that they eat a little less of the Castor & Pollux, so maybe they are getting more quality with each bite.  Iams uses by-product and Cator & Pollux uses meal, so I assume this may be the case.<br /><br />I did research on by-product vs meal & found the following information from various websites:<br /><br />Protein, in the form of quality meat ingredients, is the most important component of a pet's diet. As animals with a carnivorous background, their digestive tract is designed to utilize primarily meat and fat. It is also the most expensive ingredient for a manufacturer to buy and the profit margin on a product is drastically affected by the amount and quality used. Ideally, the first ingredient of a food should be either a specified meat meal, or a specified fresh meat type followed by a meal.<br /><br />Meat sources in ""meal"" form (as long as they are from a specified type of animal, such as chicken meal, lamb meal, salmon meal etc.) are not inferior to whole, fresh meats. ""Meal"" consists of meat and skin, with or without the bones, but exclusive of feathers/hair, heads, feet, horns, entrails etc. and have the proper calcium/phosphorus ratio required for a balanced diet. They have had most of the moisture removed, but remember that meats in their original, ""wet"" form still contain up to 75% water.<br /><br />Byproducts of any type are less desirable and only acceptable if they do not make up the main source of animal protein and if the name of the species used is also defined in some manner (e.g. ""chicken byproducts"" or ""beef byproducts"" but not ""meat byproducts"" or ""poultry byproducts""). Byproducts consist of anything but the quality cuts of meat.<br /><br />Castor & Pollux has a Pet & Soul Foundation that supports various pet organizations & charities.  Look on their website & do the daily free kibble game to donate free kibble to pet shelters.<br /><br />All in all, I think that I could probably come up with a better homemade cat food, but, given time constraints and solid know-how, I think that this Caster & Pollux dry food is a good choice.  My cats, all indoors, love the food, their fur is shiny & their skin appears to be healthy.  We do not have dander issues & all the cats seem to be feisty & healthy.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced dry food with a good list of ingredients as compared to other commercial foods. Castor & Pollux claim that they fully & unconditionally guarantee their food, so if you order & don't like it, you can call them.<br /><br />Best of all, Amazon ships it to my doorstep.  RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />10/3/11 (EDIT): I am still feeding my cats this food & they are doing well.  I now supplement with a little wet cat food (have tried many brands/varieties & a still trying to find a ""hit"") daily, but the majority of their diet is this Castor & Pollux kibble."	63	1
1	B001LGGH54	AB399AECXCDT8	a tasty and not too sweet beverage	The Switch Watermelon Strawberry beverage is a combination of juice from natural concentrate and carbonated water. The makers of this drink emphasize that their beverage has no added sugar and no artificial colors. This is shown also by the list of ingredients which consists of various types of fruit concentrate, sparkling water and some vitamin C. I really enjoyed this drink, it is flavorful but not too sweet. For your information, there are 140 calories in a serving (one container) and there are 36g carbohydrates per serving. If you are looking for a fruit drink that is not too high in calories and carbohydrates you might want to give Switch a try it is pretty good.	0	0
-1	B005HG9ESG	AJQDIT55SZ3ZX	Doesn't taste as good as some other waters	"After drinking this for 3 weeks I see no health improvements. The taste is a little off to me. My Pur sink filter water tastes better. As for the higher ph the jury is still out weather it does any good or not. I did a lot of research and you can find both pros and cons. Some very respected Medical researchers say there is no way this water going into the acid stomach can do any good. I wanted to give it an honest try. Myself I prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CQWWKY"">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 16.9-Ounce bottle (Pack of 24)</a> You can get it here at Amazon and in my case it is considerably cheaper to do it subscription vs local purchase.

1	B000QSON4K	A2JGG7FAJP1JYI	Unbelieveable!	I couldn't get my dog to take her incontinence pill (which is supposed to be a chewable). Put it in a hotdog, she would eat around the hotdog & spit the pill out. Same with any other type of food, food gone, pill left on the floor. Wrapped the pill in one of these pill pockets & she doesn't even chew, she wolfs it down so quickly. Now my only problem is getting the pill in the pocket fast enough so that I don't have to clean up a puddle of drool.	0	0

1	B001D0DMME	A8T4BQZESWHIX	Fabulous option for on-the-go snacks for those who eat Gluten Free!	"I used to regularly grab various brands of granola and meal replacement bars when I was too busy to eat a proper meal, but since becoming gluten intolerant I have found myself at a loss for what to purchase.  Even seemingly innocent products would have hidden ingredients waiting to make me feel miserable.  Anyone who is gluten intolerant (or is allergic, or has Celiac) knows how frustrating it can be to find convenient foods, despite the growing number of food producers who are aware and clearly mark their packaging as ""gluten free"".<br /><br />Then, thanks to the bride at a recent wedding I photographed, I found Kind bars.  The almond-cranberry ones were the type she offered me as a snack while the bridesmaids were getting ready, and I found them to be a fabulous mix of flavors and have a very palatable texture (perhaps a bit on the dry side, but it's a nut bar, so have something to drink handy).  The amount of fiber and protein in these bars is quite filling even with the small portion size, and there are no worries about sugar drops thanks to the low-glycemic recipe.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to not just those who are gluten intolerant, but also for anyone who wants a healthy on-the-go snack that will actually sustain you until your next meal.  So far I haven't been disappointing by any flavors I've tried and just ordered a few I haven't seen anywhere in stores and look forward to reviewing those as well."	0	0

I picked these up to try thinking that I liked the taste of honey gram plus they were 100% percent natural and 14 pieces has just 130 calories.  All criteria's were met.  Later that night when I had them with tea I also loved the flavor.  I'll be a regular buyer now.	1	0

-1	B001QECTZ8	A10GBEDF4RCOVI	Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!	"My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more ""crumbly"", i.e. there is a lot more ""food dust"" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called ""Simply Nourish"", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing ""Innova Cat & Kitten"", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe that P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it was before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!"	8	0

-1	B000LKXCD6	A1WNPWIRY9B35Q	Sodium Overload - inedible for me	"I'm not someone who is particularly sensitive to salt - I don't have high blood pressure or anything like that.  However, with 800 mg of sodium (33% of your recommended daily value) - in only 1/2 cup of this - I was a little concerned.  But, the reviews for this product are pretty much good - across the board.  So - I TRIED to like it - I really did - and the smell was incredible - I do agree that it's not got the most appealing visual effect, but I don't really care about that.  My first bite was just some of the spinach puree - and I thought ""Wow, that's good - a bit salty, but good"" - then, I had a second bite with some of the cheese, and the salt level in it hit me.  I tried one more bite after that, but that was it for me.<br /><br />I'm hoping I just received a bad batch - I most likely will try one of the other packages, but I'll prepare it with something else (maybe chick peas? Lentils? Potatoes?) to tame it.  As is, I can't eat it at all."	2	1

So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement."	0	0

-1	B007M832YY	A3NKQ6NPDL9J7Q	TASTE AVERAGE, INSANELY EXPENSIVE	These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, it's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again.<br />Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldn't be that expensive compare to local stores.	1	6
1	B0002DGRPC	AFGHXL0I9BYXD	Travis loves them; inconsistent in size.	"I have ordered these a number of times for my terrier mix (part pit bull?) - usually a little cheaper than in-store.  I initially used them for training only and then found that with the larger pieces I could jam a piece or two inside a chew toy, hide a treat toy or hollow bone that has already stood Travis' test and this can give my dog hours of enjoyment.<br /><br />My issue with them - and why I went with a 4 instead of a 5 - is the size of the pieces are inconsistent.  My first couple times there was a good mix of some larger squares - 3/4"" - 1"" cubes and smaller that I use for training bits.  My last order was completely smaller pieces - making it difficult to use it inside a toy/ bone as they come out too easily. Play time no longer lasts as long.<br /><br />I am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix. I would have given it a 5 prior to my last order.<br /><br />As a training treat these are AMAZING."	0	0

My family history (asian) includes lactose intolerant stomachs. My daughter inherited this trait and needs soy or goat milk. Simple decision for us to order this online. Could not find this product in brick stores in California or Hawaii.<br /><br />Not much to compare it to, but it works great for my family.	1	0

That makes them nearly $6 each!!!! For fruit sauce??? There are SEVERAL other brands which offer the same thing--pureed fruits and vegetables in soft squeezy packages that can be sucked out by toddlers in carseats--and they are selling for around $35 for ***24***packages of squeezies. See that difference? The stuff tastes just as good, I've tried them. In fact, the broccoli one of Ella's is disgusting, in my opinion. I like the brand that starts with a ""P"", second word Organics. Not the bunny. These get one star for pricing. The star is given because the product is nice, but 4 stars are taken away because of the complete highway robbery of offering these in a pack of only 7 for $39.95. Don't encourage them."	6	12

1	B000JZYM8C	ASFW4ZMNZJKDA	LaraBar Jocalat Chocolate Coffee -- Excellent!	"I have recently discovered LaraBars, and their whole-food sugar-free goodness. This was my first try of the Jocolat line... as has been suggested here, it's probably best to buy a single bar somewhere before buying a pack of 16 of them, and the chocolate coffee version was the only one I've found locally yet. So that was what I tried -- I love it and immediately came online to Amazon to order more.<br /><br />It's much more like a dessert than the regular LaraBars to me, almost like a brownie. I like the kick of coffee in it, and wonder if it helps with the flavor that some seem not to like. On the other hand, if you're expecting a decadent sugar-laden brownie, you will definitely be disappointed. This is a product you buy if you value whole foods and no sugar or artificial flavors. (Dates seem to be the main source of the sweet in LaraBars.) Also, if you don't like dark chocolate, this will not be for you.<br /><br />In general, I do find the texture of LaraBars takes a little getting used to. It's all those mushed up dates, which makes it very gummy, and then the contrast of the nuts. I'm past this now, but I know that some will just not like the texture.<br /><br />My only hesitation with this specific product is that I'm not entirely sure the niche this has in my diet. The regular LaraBars seem better as ""food"" (I eat them sometimes when I miss or am late for a meal). This seems more like ""dessert""."	1	0

So glad it is on Amazon now.<br /><br />Don't be thrown by the weird ""miso"" in the title - this is a great dressing for anyone who likes a slightly sweet, Asian taste.  It is a thinner (not thick, like ranch) dressing.  Well worth the price!"	0	0
1	B008NDSMT2	A17TKHPATJ7MOP	Great tasting and easy-to-make popcorn, but no size choice.	I have a six-quart whirley pop, and these packs say they make six quarts of popcorn - perfect, right? Not so much - I find that they make too much - by the time it's all popped, the popcorn is crushed a little bit because of how it's being compressed in the popper - if they offered a 4 or 5 quart version, I'd get that instead. Other than that, though - the popcorn tastes awesome, just like the movie theater.<br /><br />Pro tip: at Sam's Club you can buy a big (2 pound) container of Act II buttery popcorn salt for less than $4. It's just like the popcorn salt that comes in these packs - I add a teaspoon to the popper anytime I pop corn without these packs, and it definitely helps. Adds a yellow color too.	6	0
1	B005VOONI0	AP8D74QD9LUUL	A mild smooth coffee	There are several things a coffee lover looks for in their brew.. the aroma, the color and the taste are what I look for. When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment.	1	2

1	B004T3QMD8	A3QEJ40NQEW36Q	It's not exactly a coffee, but it's pretty good.	I'd say it's more like an alternative to hot chocolate: no real coffee taste that I could distinguish, but a nice, homey, warming flavor as you drink it.<br /><br />As with other instant blends, you have to play around a bit with the mix-to-water ratio, but when you get it right, this is an altogether pleasant drink to help you wind down at the end of a stressful day. Or even in the middle of one.	0	1

-1	B0039556K2	A162SQQTFBZO2B	Raspberry yes, chocolaty No	I was always a big fan Of Gloria Jeans Raspberry chocolate beans as they made a wonderful cup of coffee and the house smelled so good just from having the beans around.  When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.  I opened the box and no aroma, thought ok they are packed so well the aroma can't excape.  I brewed 2 cups 2 different sizes.  Smelled good while brewing.  This coffee is not strong and is very smoothe but all I could taste was the raspberry, no chocolate at all.  The next cup I actually added some chocolate milk to hoping for the chocolate to come through.  No go, that didn't even help.  If you want a raspberry flavored coffee this is good for that, but don't expect any chocolate flavor.  I have had my Keurig about 4 years and have gone through some coffee so I know what I enjoy and this isn't it and now I have 4 boxes to go through.  Maybe Van Houtte brand isn't for me.  I love Emeril's the best and maybe down the road they will get Gloria Jean's Rasberry Chocolate?	4	1

She then syphons up her half can of yum yum [i have to mix in a dozen pieces of dry kibble to slow her down]. when finished, her head pops up, eyes big as saucers, kitten-face smiling, and a dribble of saliva on her chin...ready to insist to me its dinner time..<br /><br />the boxed classic fancy feast variety is the the one to buy, the others have slices or cubes of something, NOT meat but dyed to look that way.

1	B002KLLHF4	AARHLUIV2NNI2	Excellent Medicinal Tea	I got this tea to see if it would help my brother who suffers from acute sinusitis.  We found that Cardamom Green Tea has been the most helpful and have been looking for herbal teas that can synergize with this.  The Coca Leaf Tea does this.  It seems that it is a mild systemic tonic that boosts overall health and seems to give some mental lightness and clarity.  It helps lift the brain fog that sometimes happens when he needs to take a strong anti-histamine.  The brew that we make is to add 1/2 teaspoon of the Coca Leaf Powder into 4 cups of boiling water, turn off the heat, and let simmer for about 5 minutes, and then adding a small amount of stevia as a sweetener.<br /><br />This particular batch of Coca Leaf Tea feels very fresh.  You can taste the chlorophyll.  It feels similar in this respect to a high grade Sencha powdered Green Tea.  The taste is very mellow and flavorful.  I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />One small note:  The product came in a thick plastic bag rather than the metal tin that is shown in the picture.  It seems wiser to send the tea this way as the bag seems well designed to not accidentally open.  But I was looking forward to collecting a metal tin.	0	0

1	B001TM70XS	A2O8XS3QNT0QN4	Real Quality Nutrition	I got this for my long hair male cat who has been prescribed wet food by the vet after having urinary tract problems. I read about Weruva and that the Paw Lickin' Chicken would be good for him and keep his urine pH at levels to prevent struvite crystals, just like the vet prescribed food. The Paw Lickin' Chicken has a lot of water and low magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium. But unlike the veterinarian recommended food, it has no byproducts or fillers or grains. Weruva actually looks like food, not gruel, and it doesn't have an unpleasant smell like a lot of cat foods. Weruva costs almost as much as the vet prescribed brand, but Weruva is clearly made with superior ingredients. I will still be monitoring my cat for any problems, but so far this food is working fine for him and I feel better knowing he is on a better quality food.<br /><br />At first my cat was hesitant to eat the Weruva food, but I believe that was simply because he wasn't used to the texture. The Weruva chicken is shredded into fine strips, rather than minced. My cat would drink the juices, as he had no problem with the flavor, but was reluctant to actually eat the chicken. So I had to mix it with the prescription food he had been eating before he would eat the Weruva food by itself. It is a good idea to mix the food with what your cat has been eating, anyway, so they can gradually get used to it. Now my cat doesn't hesitate and will eagerly eat the Weruva food.	47	3

1	B001EQ4IMA	A39OSL9YIIROA7	I really love the lemonade flavors of crystal light...	What I noticed about lemonade flavors in general is that it is a stronger flavor than other flavors. I actually don't like anything TOO sweet and I try not to consume too much artificial sweeteners, so I only use 1/2 of this for the water suggested... Actually I cut it down to 1/3 and it turned into more like a sweet tea ish flavor. I was hooked on diet sodas and then I started using this as a replacement and now I'm cutting down on this as well! :)<br /><br />Also nice thing to have in your pocket when you wanna mix it with cocktails without adding unnecessary calories.	0	0

1	B000VPKYSW	AM45SEDUILCHI	Somewhat weak, but pretty good.	"The tea bags are smaller than I'm used to getting from Bigelow, so the tea itself is weaker with the same steep time.  Sugar and cream are absolutely required however, as it is only boardline palletable straight.  If you are expecting something along the lines of hot chocolate in tea form, you will be dissappointed.  There is a hint of chocolate in here, but its overpowered by the ""hazelnut"" which itself isn't exactly like any other hazelnut flavor I've ever tasted.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it is actually an enjoyable tea, but no one I've given it to as a blind taste test have been able to guess ""chocolate hazelnut"" as the flavor.  Several got that there was chocolate in it, but that was the closest anyone could guess.<br /><br />Very good as a late night relaxation hot tea, I honestly could not picture drinking this cold (and do not intend to try).  Once I'm finished with the box though, I do not intend to buy more.  It was an interesting novelty tea, but it isn't something I would drink on a regular basis.<br /><br />On a side note, I bought this tea at a Target for far less than the listed price plus shipping here on Amazon.  Indeed try it for yourself, but don't buy from here."	0	0
1	B000PDFRVY	AY12DBB0U420B	Interesting Product!	"Here's one I would never have anticipated. When our 10-month-old son first started going on solid foods, my wife spotted these ""cheese puff"" things in our local grocery store. Our boy instantly loved them. We now use them in a variety of situations. We have a container in the baby's room and another in his stroller and in the car. They all work in much the same way. Whenever the boy gets cranky, we show him the container and it immediately grabs his attention. He gets real excited when we open it and hold out a crunchy. It almost always stops the whining immediately. Amazing! We've even had him in the grocery store and he got real excited when he spotted them on the shelf. That time we had to buy the puffs just to get through the rest of our shopping.<br /><br />In any case, the Lil' Crunchies resemble Cheese Puffs for adults, but have a much milder flavor. They seem to dissolve in the mouth and have presented no choking difficulties as long as we wait for the first to be gone before giving the boy a second. Now that he's teething, he likes to attempt to chew them up. The Crunchies are available in several flavors, but the boy likes the cheese the best. It's an interesting product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"	2	0

-1	B004ZWRA6G	A3PJZ8TU8FDQ1K	Peppermint for the first kiss, ginseng for the libido	"Trident Vitality is more or less an overpriced breath mint with ginseng panacea. Some buyers no doubt are looking for an energy boost while others hope for increased nitric oxide output (improvements in erectile dysfunction). I just wanted to rid my mouth of a club sandwich stink (it worked). This is not a popping, snapping, long-time chewing gum but it will revive your breath.<br /><br />Taste: The peppermint is strong enough to mask what I ate for lunch without searing my taste buds. The ginseng itself is not perceptible beneath the ""peppy peppermint.""<br /><br />Texture: The light candy coating melts away to a soft chew with ginseng grit. As the crunching effect disappears the consistency becomes sinewy -- about 3-to-4 minutes -- and less enjoyable to chew. By this time, my breath is minty and I dispose of the gum.<br /><br />Packaging: If a gum company ever needed to submit itself to Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging Trident would be the one. Most pellet packs slide into a cardboard sleeve. Trident instead chose to engineer an entire box to house nine pieces of gum. Overkill? Yes. User-friendly? No.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.<br /><br />BTW: The American Dental Association finds that the physical action of chewing these gums for 20 minutes after eating stimulates saliva flow, which helps to prevent cavities by reducing plaque acids and strengthening teeth."	0	1

We originally bought these mints at a local store to start a family tradition of remembering Grandfather's story of the wonderful chocolates wrapped in shiny paper on the tree as his only Christmas gift as a child in Europe. Now we cannot find them in stores, but glad we can buy them though Amazon. They are the most delicious mints ever!	0	0

Get one of these: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00189XVXA"">Brabantia 298004 Clip Top 4/5-Liter Plastic Canister</a> for another $13.<br /><br />Keep the canister of yeast on the freezer door.  When you need yeast, get it out, measure what you need, and put it back.  Never let the contents warm up.<br /><br />According to Harold McGee, author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012"">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a>, yeast should be dissolved in 110 water.  That feels pretty hot to the touch.  Use a thermometer until you have {ahem} the feel of it.<br /><br />Yeast ""works"" best at about 95.

1	B000WUVZCK	A28LQ2L93KPF7W	Great Reviews for a Reason	"My cats are both picky eaters and they loved these treats. It really does help freshen their breath. One of my cats was called ""dumpster kitty"" by her previous owner because her breath was so stinky (and thus her fur smelled awful too). This has cured the problem, and these treats are also great for training. Definitely making this a regular purchase."	3	0

1	B004NSKWMQ	A1ILWPH1GHUXE2	I am liking this chocolate!	"I had not heard of Scharffen Berger chocolate before, so I was looking forward to sample of their Mocha Dark Chocolate with Freshly Roasted Coffee to review.  After trying this product I must say that I really enjoyed it and look forward to eating the rest of the batch.  :)<br /><br />Scharffen Berger Mocha Chocolate is 62% cocoa, which is higher than most mass produced chocolates American eat but not as high as the 70% and 80% cocoa bars I have tried in the past.  As such, this is a dark chocolate but not quite a ""bittersweet"" chocolate to me.  Those used to consuming milk chocolate may find the taste strong, but I think it is wonderful.  The key differentiation of this product, however, is the introduction of ground fresh roasted coffee to the mix.  The ground coffee adds a bit of graininess to the chocolate and a strong hint of ""mocha"" flavor, though I don't think it overwhelms the basic chocolate flavor at all.  To me it is a great combination, and I highly recommend Scharffen Berger Mocha Chocolate to dark chocolate lovers.<br /><br />Note: According to Wiki, Scharffen Berger was an independent chocolate producer in the San Fransisco Bay area that was acquired by the Hershey Company in 2005. Scharffen Berger continues to produce chocolate under this name, now at a plant in Illinois."	3	1
-1	B000084EZ4	A2QN3DLPE7K80B	wellness canned cat food	We bought a case of this cat food and our cats liked it and seemed to do well.  After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it.  Thought it might have been a bad can so we tossed what was left.  Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days.  We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally.  I don't know if this was just a bad case of food or if Wellness has a quality control problem, but I would hesitate to purchase another product from Wellness.	4	2

If you are trying to get away from caffeine and don't like the dark roast decaf that seems to be predominant (at least in my area), this is a great alternative, tastes like real coffee, most decafs don't in my opinion. Takes a few more beans to brew a strong cup, but it is decaf, some I have tried seem to have flavor added, this has the smell and appearance of the real thing.	1	0

1	B001EQ4OWO	A1YC9KSB8602G4	Great Value!	I'm really pleased with these bags. They come with holes punched in the top of the bag so you can hang them on a hook and just grab one as you head out the door with your dog. My dog is small/medium sized (a Bedlington Terrier) and these bags are just the right size for his poop. They're big enough that, after I've got the poop inside, I can tie a knot in the top of the bag -- making it a simple matter to just toss the bag in a trash can along our walk. I've found these bags to be plenty sturdy, too. Finally, what a great price! My local pet supply store sells these bags at $9.99 for 50. Amazon's price is like getting almost 2 1/2 boxes free. Such a deal.	0	0

1	B004IA1W6E	AG61EFVSSZQXC	Not what I envisioned...	The picture is misleading. The product arrived in a bubble wrap package with advertising, about 10 times the size needed for the 2x3 inch plastic ziplock containing the actual strainer bag. They could've shipped it in a letter size envelope for less than a buck, but they charged me nine extra to send me crap that I threw away. Once I opened the product I immediately noticed that it was sewn all the way around with a double cross stitch. Looks like it'll hold up, but the picture implied that it was without a seam, which is what I really wanted. I used it once so far, for kefir, and it felt very thin, but it is a very fine filter mesh so it makes sense. It's also somewhat bigger than I thought it would be. I wouldn't buy this product again for this purpose, but I'll try using it for coffee as the reviewer before me has.<br />It's not actually a four star product in my view, but it's not so bad as three stars and there's no in between.	3	0

This time she got an entire box for herself.  Really good stuff!<br /><br />Try Cook's Illustrated Best Chocolate Cake,...bet you can't stop eating it.  It's super quick and easy to throw together.  No sickening sweet sugary frosting and just perfect.  I use this Frontier cocoa,  of course.<br /><br />BEST EASY CHOCOLATE CAKE:<br /><br />Makes one 8-inch-square cake.  Published March 1, 2009.  From Cook's Illustrated.<br /><br />We recommend using one of the test kitchen's favorite baking chocolates, Callebaut Intense Dark L-60-40NV, or Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bar for this recipe, but any high-quality dark, bittersweet, or semisweet chocolate will work. Instead of confectioners' sugar, the cake can also be served with sweetened whipped cream.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (7 1/2 ounces)<br />1 cup sugar (7 ounces)<br />1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />1/4 teaspoon table salt<br />1/2 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder (2 ounces)<br />2 ounces bittersweet chocolate , chopped fine (see note)<br />1 cup fresh black coffee, hot<br />2/3 cup mayonnaise<br />1 large egg<br />2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br />Confectioners' sugar (for serving; optional)<br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray 8-inch-square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.<br /><br />2. Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. In separate bowl, combine cocoa and chocolate; pour hot coffee over cocoa mixture and whisk until smooth; let cool slightly. Whisk in mayonnaise, egg, and vanilla. Stir mayonnaise mixture into flour mixture until combined.<br /><br />3. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top. Bake until wooden skewer inserted into center of cake comes out with few crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes.<br /><br />4. Let cake cool in pan on wire rack, 1 to 2 hours. Dust with confectioners' sugar, cut into squares, and serve straight from the pan; or turn cake out onto serving platter and dust with confectioners' sugar.	2	0
1	B004JRXZKM	A1U208VXZ6J5HA	zero-calorie filler	I have been eating these for months. I also enjoy kelp noodles (low but not zero calorie) but these are different in many ways. They do have an initial odd smell but once rinsed, they are fine. They don't require any cooking. I add them to almost any, already prepared carbohydrate. Yes, of course you could use them in place of pasta in the expected dishes but many of us largely gave up pasta years ago during the Atkins craze. 80) For those of us who don't eat pasta regularly, I would recommend integrating them into rice or whatever the carb. I'm personally reluctant to cut out carb calories completely; so mixing them to reduce my intake works best for me. Think of them as filler, which they are. Their consistency is sort of gelatinous but similar to al dente pasta (except that they don't stick to your teeth). Because of their consistency, I'm not sure I would add them to purees, unless using the puree like a sauce. For a low-calorie meal with this fettuccine variety, I like to prepare them with a Thai peanut sauce using PB2 and other healthier alternatives (e.g., apple sauce in place of oil, etc). I usually add spinach, and chicken to increase protein levels. I prefer this variety of miracle noodle - and sometimes cut the noodles to meet my needs - but they do have other shapes/cuts that might work better with a wider variety of recipes. They also sell a variety that includes soy (and consequently contains some calories) - for those who still embrace soy as a protein-rich carb.	0	0

1	B004FEN3GK	A3U029B8Z5WGI2	Really Convenient For Those With Young Kids	I love these little snack pack sized graham crackers.  As a mom of two toddlers (2 years and 3 years respectively), graham crackers are a staple in all situations - particularly during car rides.  However in most cases, I don't need 8 full sheets of graham crackers to give to my kids - I'd probably only need about half of that.  This is where the brilliance of the Honey Maid Fresh Stacks come in: each pack contains 8 half sheets of graham crackers.  I don't have to spend any time opening a pack and putting half the crackers into a ziploc bag which will probably be forgotten in the back of the cupboard.  I don't have to worry about graham crackers going stale because my husband tossed some crackers in a ziploc for the kids, but didn't bother sealing the remaining crackers up before tossing them back into the cracker box.  I can put a pack of these crackers into my kid's travel backpack or in the car one day, and open it up weeks later when I actually need the crackers because the kids are starving.  Brilliant, I tell you.<br /><br />While I'll still buy the conventional 3 stacks per box type graham crackers (we can eat a lot of graham crackers), I think I'll be picking up the Fresh Stacks for our day trips - it's so convenient!  Highly recommended!	0	0

1	B001O08SQI	A1YS7A4OG0L4G2	Good value - maybe not the highest quality for drinking straight	"This is a great price, and good for cooking/blending in smoothies. With hot tea, still enjoyable, but the taste is a little sub par in quality compared to some of the ""finer"" matcha products. For example, I wouldn't recommend drinking this ""alone"" with hot water as in a traditional japanese hot matcha tea; I'd add some looseleaf green or a tea bag to bring out the true flavor. Other matchas that I've tried, to contrast, stand up on their own (and a little goes a long way  - unlike this matcha, where I felt I was adding more to get the same ""green"" taste.)<br /><br />The correct way to prepare is to add a bit of powder to an empty cup, add some hot (not boiling) water and stir briskly with a bamboo whisk or fork until blended. You can then add hot milk, more water, etc to your taste.<br /><br />This also tastes great mixed into yogurt, milk/berry smoothies. It's a small tin - note the 1.06 ounce size - but this is pretty standard for matcha. Using the subscribe and save feature knocks off more dollars off the price (compare to $30+ at Whole Foods for rishi brand matcha, same size).<br /><br /> Overall, it's definitely a very good product, unless you're a super-discerning tea drinker - and I recommend it!"	7	1

1	B000GLON6U	A31CAX02NNPZX2	Good choice for ferrets	Not all ferrets will like this, but the extremely high level of protein and extremely low level of carbohydrates - not to mention the natural ingredients and all-around high quality of manufacturing - make Instinct a top choice for mixing with ferret foods, as many ferret shelters are now doing instead of feeding a single brand. Cat foods used to be a no-no in ferretland but the new crop of super high protein foods such as Instinct is changing people's minds.<br /><br />I feed my ferrets (who are always elderly and always have either insulinoma, adrenal disease, lymphoma, or all of the above) a mix of Instinct cat food, Innova Evo ferret food, and ZuPreem ferret food, and they are doing very well on it. After 8 years or so I think I've finally found a combination of foods that works for elderly ferrets fighting cancer. As I say above, some ferrets do not like the taste of Instinct at all, but I've found that introducing it to them in a mix with other brands that they do like helps them change their minds.	3	1

1	B000SDO5YQ	A332ZFX8S3A155	Good coffee	I own an espresso machine and love coffee. However the machine is a pain to use when I'm in a rush to work in the morning, which is most mornings.  I was thinking about getting a Keurig pod machine to make my mornings easier, however I didn't want to have yet another appliance sitting on my counter.  Then I remembered that my espresso maker came with an ESE (easy serve espresso) pod adapter so I decided to give these pods a try based on the good reviews.<br /><br />Although clean up is a lot easier, the coffee pods are a bit weak in flavor.  I make Americanos in the morning, and one pod in 8oz of water is not quite strong enough for me.  Two pods is perfect.  I will no doubt need to use 4 pods for my travel mug to get the bold flavor that I desire.  Overall, the coffee is good and cleanup is easy.	0	0

She's always had a bit of a problem with throwing up so i didn't notice itr at first.  But now that I've had a few months of experience with it I can confirm that it makes her throw up.  I would say 7 out of 10 times she throws up not even after, but while she's eating it!  At first I didn't think anything about it, I thought she was just randomly throwing up.  But today I noticed she threw up while she was near finishing what I had put down for her.  So just as a test I decided to give her a little more and she threw up in less than a minute of eating it.<br /><br />So, I don't know what to tell you.  Maybe it's just my cat.  I can't imagine they sell this and it happens to every car!  My cat is 16 and in really good health considering her age.  But maybe it's age related, I don't know.  I just know i won't bed able to give her this anymore.  But I'm going to have to find a good substitute fast because she's so addicted to it, she starts yelling for more every day at the same time!!	5	1

1	B000FPFC4O	A3T0388BB6KD28	Great Cookie	"These cookies are a great member of the Cherrybrook Kitchen family. I've noted that some people have stated that they have a gritty texture. Although they are a bit more ""gritty"" than traditional wheat cookies, they are the best wheat free mix that I have found. They cook up quick and easy. In addition, they are the ONLY milk and egg free mix that I have found that<br />1. That works<br />2. Tastes yummy<br />3. You don't have to use egg replacer, etc.<br />These are also great to eat RAW since they don't have egg. My son's favorite thing to do is make the dough, cool it, and dip it in melted Enjoy Life Chocolate chips to make chocolate chip cookie dough bon bons. A favorite of everyone at our house :)"	0	0

1	B0037X4QDO	AU54V57YOEXTV	NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND	Bitters go in and out of style.  They are only called for in a few drinks (or food dishes) but are just imperative for an Old Fashioned or Manhattan.  Bitters are certainly a matter of taste, but this brand is considered by many to be the gold standard.<br /><br />The House of Angostura has a long and storied history, and a shortage of bottles a few years ago put their product in short supply, probably worsened by hoarding.  Angostura is back, with its famous oversized labels, but it is absent from most local shelves, so Amazon is a reliable source.<br /><br />A bottle this size will last me a lifetime, and I just might mention it in my will.	2	0
1	B001N3UYOA	A24FP9KQI0SDE5	Fabulous Pizza Sauce	"Hi Folks, I'm very surprised that no one has tried this sauce and felt moved to write a review.  I'll try and do it justice.  First you will notice the texture, it is lite, with chunks of tomato.  You get the feeling that you are the one making it, reducing the sauce but you stop before it goes too far.  The texture is unlike any other I have ever experienced.  Being use to the industrial blender smooth and heavy feel of typical commercial sauces I knew I was on to something when I first spread this one.  Once you've baked it up with you favorite topping you will absolutely melt when you taste it.  I said to myself, ""where have you been all my life""?  Again the taste is lite and zesty, definitely say ""hello, how do you like me now""!  I hope you will give it a try.  I plan on hunting down and trying their other sauces.  Good Luck and Enjoy!"	9	1

Large dried cherries, plenty of pistachios and I believe there are even almonds as well as multi-grains.  We reordered in different flavors hoping to find them as tasty.

1	B000U96JEC	A19SDJ2TSSL8HI	Really Good If You Make A Few Adjustments	"I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.<br /><br />What to do??<br /><br />I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes ""okay"" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:<br /><br />Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.<br /><br />The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency. I like it best on salads."	6	0

1	B003FDC2I2	A1SD9TIB9VJ38Y	A lot to like	"What's really important about Orgain is the fast infusion of protein it gives you when you are really in need of a boost.  It goes to work within a minute.  If you're famished or feel hypo-glycemic, you'll really appreciate having one.<br /><br />The new Mocha flavor is far and away my favorite.  It tastes less sweet and has a subtle coffee taste. It is a pleasure to drink.<br /><br />The only reason I give Orgain 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'd prefer it didn't rely on the 13 grams of sugar it contains.  Sugar just isn't a nutritional plus, and nowadays, with alternatives like xylitol available, there is room to improve this very good product.<br /><br />I've tried other ""smoothies"" and supplement powders that you add to water, and none of them cut it.  Orgain is the best product of its kind out there."	1	0

Also these are not chunks but they are thin like meat skin lumps.

I did not feel any problems and i feel the company is reliable. For any one curious, check out evercompanion dot com for parent company.	7	1
1	B009GHI5Q4	A36YQ0J0T76003	My kitty LOVES it.	The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.	0	0

1	B002JANPDI	A16KY8ZIQL6XGC	Great for those avoiding sugars	I first had these at a party...I was (am) doing South Beach and am in a still restrictive stage, though not a solid stage one and really thought this could make a difference after trying it with a lemon (that became lemonade) and a blander grape tomato (which became a sungold) and some goat cheese, that just got sweeter.<br /><br />My plan was to have a grapefruit and plain yogurt be a sweet treat and it totally worked, even the plain yogurt is sweeter. Gin, lime and soda water tastes like it's sweetened (not as much as say, Sprite). Same with unsweetened flavored seltzers. It's pretty amazing with the foods it works with. They are expensive, but it's doing wonders to keep me on track. And since they don't last very long with items as creamy as the yogurt I can't really overdo it, which is a total bonus. It also takes the bitterness out of teas and coffee. Dark stout beers get really sweet. Be careful. They're not all good, as in an all-the-time-thing, but it certainly is fun.	1	0
1	B000HEUIB0	A1ZH3LZC21RSZD	Old time sugary goodness that last ages	Individually wrapped, you can drop these into a purse or gym bag and they will wait patiently for you to pop one in.

I also wish they were lower in carbs.  They can get rid of those carb fillers and up the price if they need.  That tiny bit of carb filler makes a big difference for those of us watching our carbs, and I would love to see those removed, leaving only the carbs used for flavor.  I can only eat a few in a single day because of those darn fillers.  WAH!	0	0

1	B000FQ0PS6	A1LINA8MCSONQL	Best soda ever made :)	Being from Michigan, I grew up drinking Squirt.  It wasn't until I married and moved out of state that I realized this soda is rarely seen in stores outside of Michigan, Illinois and Ohio.  It's disappointing as this has to be one of the most refreshing, clean tasting sodas out there.  I would have to say the closest other brand is Fresca, though Fresca has an overly sweet flavor in comparison.  Squirt soda is really clean and crisp with the definite tart of grapefruit, perfect for a summer BBQ.  It's also a great for mixed drinks. Even the diet version is really good as there isn't much flavor difference from that of the full calorie version.  Whenever we have friends or family visit from home we always have them bring us a few cases.	0	1

1	B0045XE32E	AZ0PCEZUTF5QO	My Dogs Love 'Em!	Newman's Lamb and Barley dog treats have been happily, and eagerly, devoured by both dogs in the house: a Siberian husky, and a Jack Russell terrier. The ingredients in the treats are organic and natural, without anything weird or unusual (like colors, stabilizers, preservatives, etc). The treats are odorless and come in a re-sealable ziploc pouch.<br /><br />The treats are rectangular with an indentation down the center to allow (in theory) one to break the treat in half. Even half of the treat, though, seems a bit large for smaller dogs. Additionally, the treats are so hard and dry, that breaking them in two can be difficult. Fortunately, a good number arrived pre-broken, and those are the ones the JRTs been getting. The hardness of the treats makes me think they're probably good for the dog's teeth, and each pup takes a while to eat them. They can leave crumbs, but dogs are usually pretty adept at getting every last morsel, so there's never been any mess left-over.	1	2
1	B007M832YY	AQJYXC0MPRQJL	Great chip that is different from the rest	I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.	1	0

The coffee tasted even worse than instant in a jar. You could so easily put a table of instant coffee in hot water and get the same thing. I probably should read the box more carefully, but on the box it said ""instant & microground coffee"". There's no ground coffee whatsoever.

The tasty topping seals in juices and prevents you meat from drying out.  If you want an easy way to prepare pork chops with minimal mess and preparation, then Shake n Bake for Pork is for you.	2	0
1	B000E4C1OK	ARGQRYAWQ5P2F	A BIG **** Five Way *****	As a former Cincinnatian, short a special trip to Cincinnati, this is a wonderful alternative. I used it when I lived in Cincy ... and now in CA.  I use it here for theme dinners (both the spaghetti and a chili dog) with friends ... always a hit.  I suggest adding less water initially or reducing the amount of water via extended simmering.  The former maybe a better approach so less gas or electricity is used.	0	0

1	B004G5ZYRY	A3QX2CMKK413PL	THE BEST CHEW ON THE MARKET	"I adore this chew.  Two years ago I gave up chewing tobacco, the wife and the doc teamed up on me and finally convinced me it was time to stop playing chew Russian roulette.  It was tough to quit, I'd been chewing since I was eleven and half.  The idea was, give up the chew first and then tackle the cigarettes.  Well I'm happy to announce that last July with the help of hypnosis, the Patch, and plenty of nicotine gum, I am a non smoker!  Now watch, I'll get hit by buy a bus :) I'm just joshing.  Sure I put on a few pounds, a hundred and thirteen to be exact.  My shrink said I had an oral fixation and suggested a number of remedies, rebirthing, joggin, getting my jaw wired shut, tummy tucks, fake cigarettes, you know just something to stick in my kisser, hell I tried the works, but nothing seemed to do the trick.  Until accidently I stumbled upon these Antler Chews.  I had bought a couple for my dog ""Swiderski,"" and one night while he was enjoying one at my feet, I was having myself a plate of ribs watching the Braves game.  And you know me, all thumbs, I dropped a rib to the floor.  Well I reached down real quick to grab it and accidently picked up Swiderski's antler.  And Lawdy lawd I tell you what, I was home.  These are TAAAASSSSSTY, I'll never buy a pack of beef jerky again.  I've dropped eighty eight pounds to date, and I don't go anywhere without my new chew.  I keep one in the glove box of my truck, and I've got em in every room in the house. Hell I've fallen asleep sucking these chews.  I know it's somewhat of a cliche but they do taste a little like chicken, and I stress, they are not overwhelming.  I couldn't tell you how many packs of smokes I'd go through when I'd get to drinking my beer, but now I can go a good three or four months with just one antler.  Whew baby!  For any of you out there with an oral fixation or those who just wanna drop a few pounds, these deer antlers'll do the trick. My compliments to the chef.  God does work in mysterious ways."	3	1
1	B000N62E9G	A2WV42P3B8EGC2	Good Quality Food	I became concerned with my cat's weight and the dry, compact stools showing up in her litter.  After doing some research, I decided to transition her from her grain-free dry to this.  It took a few days of mixing the two but she now gobbles this up.  I do notice a drop in her weight, an increase in her activity level, and an improvement in her stools (no more straining).  Guess that is a little TMI but how else does one evaluate a cat food?  Anyway, I am pleased with this food.	1	0
1	B004E4EBMG	A1LJR5IS0B6ADX	Really has a nice taste	"This water enhancer by MIO is really, really good.  The flavor in question is ""Mango Peach"" and I found that these two flavors balanced very well together.  The first flavor I tasted was mango and then chased by peach.  It was also nice that is no aftertaste with this product.<br /><br />The application is simple; just fill a glass with water, squirt a shot or two of this liquid enhancer and stir.  Personally, I use less than recommended because I don't want an overbearing flavor.  Nevertheless, an individual has the ability to make their beverage as mild or strong as they wish.  I also like the ""non leak"" packaging.  The only way the liquid comes out is if the container/bottle is squeezed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good product with a good taste.  I have already tried the strawberry, peach tea and look forward to trying other flavors."	1	0
-1	B005GYULZY	ADP8ROI8NMNL2	What?	This was not at all what I expected. It was like the old-school roll-on deoderant from the 1970's. Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it. Like a dog would do.<br /><br />Try again. Fail.	1	6
1	B005K0L2U2	A353Y7VBQHHW0T	Great Product.  Never going back to the overpriced k-cups	I have been using this item now for about a week.  I have been using it with Peet's coffee.

1	B007PA32L2	A2QFMDFM2SH864	Not the strongest coffee, but a nice fall flavor	Generally if coffee has flavor, I prefer it to be sweet rather than spicy (I do not even like cinnamon flavored coffee or creamers), so I was a bit unsure how pumpkin flavor would blend with coffee.  It is actually a nice blend.  The pumpkin and spice flavors, while apparent, are not overpowering and blend well with the coffee, rather than competing with it.  It smells wonderful, and if I could pump the smell through the house 24/7, I would.<br /><br />The coffee itself is a bit on the weaker side.  I realize that flavored coffee is not going to have the same bold flavor as a dark roast, but this is weaker than other flavors I have tried (and there have been many!). As with most k-cups, I recommend brewing on the smallest setting.  The smallest setting on my Keurig is 6 ounces; if your model has a smaller size setting, I would suggest trying it.  It is definitely worth picking up a box if you enjoy the flavors of fall.	1	0
1	B00250UINW	A8762MZRMFYIU	Not too sweet and YUMMY	Unlike many GF cereals, including other mueslis, Brookfarm's product is not sugary sweet nor does it have the taste and consistency of cardboard or bricks. It is perfectly crunchy, tasty, and filling. It's great for breakfast with or without milk or for a snack. And since it doesn't have any added sugar, it doesn't make your hands sticky when eating out of the pouch in front of your computer or in the car :-)<br /><br />There is only one problem with this product which is that Amazon cannot keep it in stock. There is usually one bag available and you need at least two of them for super saver shipping. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. It's on my top 10 list of GF foods, and since I have been a celiac since 1998, I've tasted a lot of them.	3	0

-1	B004CGVTF8	A1WBRU3PLCGUEM	Disappointed	"The one positive with these cigars is that the chocolate is actually edible, which was my main concern when ordering this item.  Its not great chocolate, more ""fundraiser"" quality, but at least its edible.<br /><br />The problem with the cigars is that they are not actually cigar shaped.  Instead, they are shaped like half a cigar, a flattened tube instead of a circular tube.  From the photo this is not obvious, but in person you have to do a double take to fully understand that these chocolates are supposed to represent cigars.  Honestly, it looks a little like a suppository in person.  Having said that, non-smokers loved these things, but I was a little disappointed."	0	0
1	B00882A7FU	A2RZEH6WIUH8MT	Excellent on the Grill	"This Tandoori BBQ Chicken mix is very good.<br />We received a lot of compliments on this recipe when we grilled it last summer and our guests went out of their way to say ""wow"", that's good... what recipe is that?  It's very flavorful and a little spicy but not hot or anything.<br /><br />We originally found Shan Tandoori spice mix at a tiny 4 table restaurant/grocery store for $1.99 when the owner happened to stock it for a while.  I went back to get more but they quickly ran out so I'm glad to find it here also.  There are literally several hundred other interesting spice mixes like this from overseas once you know where to look.<br /><br />Maybe Amazon can work with more vendors on this type of product since Shan Tandoori mix sells online for $1.25 at 'America's largest online India Grocer'.  Amazon has them as a partner already so I figured it's ok to mention there's hundreds of other recipes to try that aren't listed here yet.<br /><br />Most of these recipes call for lots of fresh vegetables such as garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, fresh ginger, etc.  Over the next few weeks we'll try some of the other variations....<br /><br />Aaloo Bhaji Curry Mix<br />Chappli Kabab Masala<br />Tandoori Chicken BBQ<br />Bombay Biryani Masala<br />Dopiaza / Stew Curry<br />Maesri Masaman Curry<br />Tikka Seekh Kabab BBQ<br />Parampara Prawn Masala"	1	0
1	B0044BUSCQ	A3SFS8R1T6JJM9	Daughter Likes It...	My daughter likes this product.  It may not be love, but it is edible, at least to her standards.  She is not picky.  She has been an Earth's Best baby since she was 10 weeks old.  I started her on baby food, in addition to her formula, early on.  It just seemed like the right thing to do.  She has been the happiest baby some people have ever met.  When I fed this to her the first time, she ate half a package.  I had a bite and it is pretty good.  I will buy it again, definitely.	0	0

1	B0030VBQ5Y	A3995IX7VLDBAY	use as meal on the go or flavoring for food	My 12 month old likes to eat these food packets when we go camping. We also use these to mix into meals like in pasta with veggies. He ends up eating more of his meal when we use these for sauces. I think it adds a little extra flavor and moisture to some meals. I always keep 1-2 of these foods packets in the diaper bag just in case we get stuck somewhere longer than expected-like a trip to the grocery store. They are handy and nutritious on the run, in the woods or in the car.	0	0
1	B0025UC2DQ	AMDREWLSOT8ID	Amazing	I can hardly believe how tasty this stuff is. I was first introduced to stevia sweetener in the Sobe Lifewater drinks. I knew that I had to find some for at-home use. I now use it regularly in my breakfast tea, smoothies, etc. Since they're in the packets, I haven't tried Truvia in baking, but I can say that it is great in drinks. Also, I don't experience any digestive problems or gross aftertaste that people often get with other types of sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose.<br /><br />Purchasing it on Amazon is an amazing deal. With this quantity I won't be running out of it anytime soon, but I'll definitely be back for more.	7	1

-1	B003LPSIO6	A3OTIR56OYMEIL	Decent cat litter	"I used to buy World's Best Cat litter when my cats were kittens then I switched to Fresh Step after they turned 1 year old. The world's best litter is pricy and does not absorb odor well. My first Fresh Step litter is the original Natural Scoop which is much more affordable and is able to minimize the odor not to mention it's 99% natural. My cats had no trouble adapting to it. But for some reason, Fresh Step stop carrying the Natural line so i had to get the ""Perfume and Dye free"" which is slightly cheaper and does a even better job with odor control but it seems to be phasing out as well (I checked fresh step web site and they no longer display that line). I'm quite disappointed that they stop producing both these litter. The new Natural pack does not have good reviews... I'm hoping that they bring back the original Nature and continue to produce the Perfume & Dye Free litter."	2	2
-1	B000ELVUKY	A2RVQMCP9RL2MU	Lets get a little honesty in the house	I think the cheap price has effected honest ratings here. Nothing special about Fast Twitch, in fact this formula is pretty old. Alot of improvements been made to pre workout products over the last 6-7 years and this Fast Twitch is exactly the same today as it was back then. Even back then it wasn't the best pre workout on the market or even close to it. This formula is dated and Arginine has been proven ineffective in fairly recent studies. Glycocyamine has been removed from most pre workouts due to health risk that it provides, but of course Fast Twitch still contains it. L-Citrulline, Citrulline Malate are solid ingredients in this product, but it's going to be dosed fairly low considering the Arginine is the first ingredient in this part of the blend. This has a pretty good Electrolyte blend in it, I will give it that. Not enough to justify using it as your go to pre workout powder. This has some funky type of creatine in it Kre-Alkalyn, which has proven to be a bunch of hype and mumbo jumbo. Stick to CreaPure monohydrate if you want a good source of creatine. Fast Twitch is a little higher in carbs than I like for a pre workout as well. That would just be filler Maltodextrin.<br /><br />All in all it's not a total waste, it's not to bad for the low price on here. If you're really poor and must have something pre workout this would be a decent option. To make it worth the while you'd be best off ordering two at a time to get the free shipping saver, only thing about it I liked the product better when it was $16, it went up $2 since last week. So if you order two you will have around $37 wrapped up into it. You'd be much better off order Superpump Max by Gaspari nutrition for $28 with free shipping saver. A much much better formula. I will leave the best for the last, the fruit punch fast twitch taste bad, it doesn't taste like fruit punch, more like medicine or chemicals. Hope you're a trooper because you will have to be a solider to drink this stuff. The grape fast twitch on the other hand isn't half bad, but that's not on sale :( makes wonder doesn't it? Get some Superpump Max fruit punch and don't look back.....<br /><br />And honest review with no hyped included.....	1	0

"When I was a kid (and dinosaurs roamed the Earth), I used to get a bag of Gummi Bears just like these, and a bar of Milka<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024G8WI"">World's Best Milka Chocolate - Alpine Milk, 10 Bars</a> from my Oma and Opa in Germany.  As I devoured the sweets, I used to think that I was the luckiest kid in the world.<br /><br />Unlike so many things from my childhood, these haven't changed a bit.  They still come in five colors with amazingly fresh fruit flavors. These little packets each contain about nine little bears, and are just the right size to stick in a pocket or purse for a surprise pick-me-up. I keep them in the house to comfort a boo-boos reward an unexpected high test score, or to celebrate a sunny afternoon.  This large package contains 75 little packets in a sturdy plastic box that the Haribo people encourage you to reuse.<br /><br />If these treats were a part of your childhood, you can buy these without the fear that they've changed - they haven't.  If you haven't experienced the bears that started the current craze of all things gummi, they're well worth trying.  But please, save the white ones for me!"	10	1
